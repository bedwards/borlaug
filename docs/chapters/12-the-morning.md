# Chapter 12: The Morning

The telephone rang in the dark. It rang once and then again, a flat mechanical sound that came from the hallway where the phone sat on the narrow table against the wall, and Harold heard it from inside the sleep he had been in, the sound pulling him up through the layers of it the way a hand pulls a thing from the bottom of a basin, slowly and then all at once, and he was awake. The room was dark. The curtain over the window was a lighter shade of dark, a gray rectangle in the black wall, and the phone rang again and Ruth moved beside him, the blanket shifting, the mattress adjusting to her weight as she turned.

Harold got up. His feet found the tile and the tile was cold, the cold of a Mexico City night at altitude, the thin air holding nothing of the day's warmth, and he walked to the hallway, his hand finding the doorframe, the wall, the narrow table, and he picked up the receiver.

The voice on the line was a man's voice speaking English with an accent Harold did not immediately place, Scandinavian, the vowels flattened, and the man said his name, Harold Lindgren, and Harold said yes, and the man said he was calling from Oslo, from the Norwegian Nobel Committee, and Harold stood in the hallway in the dark and listened. The man spoke for a minute, or less than a minute. The words came through the line the way words come through a telephone, slightly compressed, slightly distant, and Harold heard them and the words were that he had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

He did not say anything for a moment. The hallway was dark and the phone was in his hand and the cord ran from the phone to the wall and the man in Oslo was waiting and Harold could hear the faint static on the line, the sound of the distance between them, the thousands of miles of wire and ocean and air, and then Harold said thank you, and the man said something else, details about the ceremony, about Oslo, about December, and Harold listened and said yes, and the man said congratulations, and Harold said thank you again, and the call ended and he set the receiver back in its cradle and stood there.

Ruth was in the bedroom doorway. He could see her shape, the pale fabric of her nightgown, her hand on the frame.

Who was it, she said.

Harold told her. He said it the way he said things, plainly, the words chosen for accuracy rather than effect. Someone from Oslo. The Nobel Committee. The Peace Prize.

Ruth did not move. She stood in the doorway and the dark was between them and neither of them spoke for a time that was not long but that had a quality of suspension, a pause in which the information sat in the hallway like a physical object, something that had been set down and not yet picked up, and then Ruth said, well, and Harold said, yes.

She came to him then, and he felt her hand on his arm, the pressure of her fingers on his forearm, and she stood beside him in the hallway and they stood there together and the apartment was dark and quiet around them, the sounds of the building, the water pipes ticking as they cooled, the faint hum of the city beyond the courtyard walls, and the phone was silent on the table and the information was between them.

Harold went back to bed. He lay on his back and Ruth lay beside him and neither of them slept. He could tell from her breathing that she was awake, the rhythm of it too even, too controlled, the breathing of a person who is lying still and thinking, and he was awake too, and the ceiling was above him, the white plaster with the crack he had known for years, and the information was in the room with them, in the dark, a fact without weight or shape, a thing someone had said on a telephone, and the fact was there and the room was the same room it had been before the phone rang, the same bed, the same curtain, the same crack in the ceiling.

He thought about the field. Not deliberately, not as a choice, but the way his mind went to the field when there was nothing else holding it, the way water goes to the lowest point, and the field he thought about was Toluca, the plots on the slope above the station, the crosses he had made last week, the bags on the heads, the new lines in the test rows, the germination data that needed to be recorded, and this thinking was calm and steady and familiar and it moved through the dark room the way the water moved through the pipes in the walls, quietly, without effort, and after a while his breathing changed and Ruth's breathing changed and they slept.

The light woke him. It came through the curtain the way it always came, gray and diffused, the Mexico City morning filtered through altitude and haze, and the room was the room and Ruth's side of the bed was empty and the pillow still held the shape of her head. He could hear her in the kitchen, the tap with its stutter, the blue enamel pot set on the burner, and the sounds were the sounds of every morning, the sequence that began the day, and Harold lay still for a moment and the information from the night was there, not as a thought but as a fact his body carried the way it carried the stiffness in his lower back, the way it carried the permanent squint the years of sun had pressed into the skin around his eyes.

He got up and dressed. Trousers, the cotton shirt, the boots. He went to the kitchen and Ruth was at the stove and she had the coffee on and the light through the window fell on the counter and on the jacaranda in the courtyard, which was bare at this time of year, the branches dark and fine against the pale sky. Ruth poured the coffee through the cloth strainer and handed him the cup and her hand brushed his as the cup passed between them and the touch was brief and ordinary, the touch of two people who have handed each other cups a thousand times.

They sat at the table. The table had been in the apartment for fifteen years, a wooden table with a grain that ran in long pale lines across its surface, and the surface held the marks of those years, the rings from cups, the scratches from knives, the small burns from pots set down too hot, and Harold and Ruth sat at it and drank their coffee and the morning was quiet.

The phone will ring all day, Ruth said.

Harold looked at her. She was holding her cup in both hands, the way she held it when the morning was cool, and her face was composed, the face of a woman who had lived with the shape of Harold's life for twenty-six years and who knew what this day would bring before it brought it, the calls, the reporters, the questions she would answer because Harold would not be there to answer them, and this knowledge was in her face the way the years were in her face, not as lines or markings but as a quality of the expression itself, a steadiness that came from repetition, from having done the thing so many times that the doing of it was no longer effortful.

I should go, Harold said.

Ruth nodded. She drank her coffee and set the cup down and the cup made a small sound on the wood and she looked at him across the table and what she said next was not about the prize or the phone or the day ahead.

There are tortillas in the cloth, she said. And the beans from last night.

Harold looked at her. Her hands were on the table, the fingers laced around the cup, and her hands were the hands of a woman who had unpacked and repacked apartments in Wilmington and Mexico City and who had driven to schools and markets and who had held their children when Harold was in the field, which was most of the time, and her hands were still and her face was still and the kitchen was still and Harold looked at her and the looking held something in it that was not a word and was not a thought but was a pressure behind his eyes, a tightness in the bridge of his nose, and he breathed and the pressure was there and then it eased.

He wrapped the tortillas and the beans in a cloth and put them in the bag with his notebook and the thermos Ruth had filled. He put on his hat, the broad-brimmed hat he wore in the field, the straw darkened with years of sweat along the band, and he stood in the doorway of the kitchen and Ruth was at the table with her cup and the light from the window was behind her.

I'll be back tonight, he said.

Ruth nodded. She did not get up. She sat at the table with the coffee and the light and the day ahead of her, the telephone that would ring and the questions she would answer, and Harold stood in the doorway and looked at her and then he turned and went down the stairs and out through the courtyard, past the jacaranda, its bare branches above him, and through the gate to the street.

The truck was parked on the street. It was the same model they had always used, a flatbed with a canvas cover over the back, the Foundation's name stenciled on the door in letters that had faded and been repainted and faded again, and Harold got in and set the bag on the seat beside him and started the engine and the engine caught and he pulled away from the curb and into the morning traffic of the city.

The drive to Toluca took an hour and a half. The road climbed out of the valley of Mexico City through neighborhoods that thinned and gave way to fields, the buildings falling back, the land opening, and then the road rose into the mountains and the air changed, the temperature dropping, the haze of the city replaced by a clarity that sharpened the edges of things, the pines along the road darker and more distinct, the sky above them a deeper blue. Harold drove with both hands on the wheel, the hands stiffer than they had been, the knuckles thicker, the fingers less willing to close fully around the wheel, and the road wound through the mountains and the truck climbed and the valley of Toluca opened below him, a broad flat expanse at twenty-six hundred meters, ringed by mountains, the Nevado to the southwest with its snowcap.

He had driven this road hundreds of times. The curves were in his body the way the stool was in his body, the way the tweezers were in his hands, and he took them without thinking, the wheel turning, the truck leaning, the landscape moving past the windows in a sequence he knew. The fields in the valley were planted, some with corn, some with wheat, and the wheat fields were green, the canopy dense and low, the semi-dwarf varieties that had spread from the station to the farms around it, the farmers having seen what the short wheat did and having asked for the seed, and the seed had gone out, sack by sack, season by season, and now the valley grew it, the short wheat with the thick stems and the heavy heads, growing in fields where the tall wheat had grown before, and the change was visible from the road, the lower canopy, the denser stands, the fields that did not lodge.

The station was at the south end of the valley, set against the slope of a hill that rose toward the mountains. Harold turned off the main road onto the dirt track that led to the station, the truck bouncing on the ruts, and the station buildings came into view, the long low block of the laboratory, the seed storage shed, the equipment barn, and beyond them the plots, rows of wheat running in long parallel lines up the slope, the different varieties at different heights and different shades of green, the test plots marked with wooden stakes and string.

He parked the truck and got out and the air was cool and thin and he breathed it and the breathing was different here than in the city, the lungs working harder for the same amount of air, the altitude a fact the body acknowledged with each breath. The mountains were around him. The valley floor stretched to the north, the fields and the road and the scattered buildings of the town, and to the south the slope rose and the plots climbed it, row after row, and the wheat was there, growing.

Two men were at the station already, young agronomists who worked the plots, and they were at the table in the laboratory with the notebooks open, and they looked up when Harold came in and said good morning and Harold said good morning and hung his hat on the hook by the door and set the bag on the table and took out the notebook and opened it.

They talked about the plots. The germination in the new lines, the tiller counts, the condition of the crosses in the crossing block. One of the men, a young man named Ramirez, had found aphids on the border rows and wanted to spray, and Harold told him to check the interior rows first, to see whether the infestation had moved in or was confined to the edge, and to count the ladybirds, because the ladybirds were eating the aphids and the spray would kill both, and Ramirez nodded and wrote it down.

Harold ate the tortillas and beans at the table, the cloth unfolded, the food cold but good, the beans thick and dark, seasoned the way Ruth seasoned them, with cumin and a dried chili, and he ate and drank coffee from the thermos and the morning continued and the work was in front of him. He did not tell the men about the phone call. The information was in his shirt pocket the way the telegram had been in his shirt pocket twenty-six years ago, not a piece of paper this time but a fact carried in the same pocket, against the same chest, and the fact sat there while Harold ate his breakfast and discussed the aphids and reviewed the germination data.

He took the stool from the corner of the laboratory where it leaned against the wall. The stool was not the same stool, not the one from the Yaqui Valley, that one having broken years ago, a leg splitting along the grain, and this one was newer, lighter, but it had been sat on long enough that it had taken on the shape of his sitting, the seat worn smooth in the center, the legs darkened where his hands gripped them to set it down, and he carried it out through the door and across the yard to the crossing block.

The crossing block was a rectangular plot at the base of the slope, thirty meters by twenty, fenced with wire to keep the rabbits out, and inside the fence the wheat grew in close rows, the parent lines on one side and the progeny on the other, and the progeny were the crosses from the previous season, the plants that carried the combinations Harold had made, the traits he had brought together, disease resistance from one parent and yield from another and the dwarfing gene from a third, the combinations that might produce something useful or might produce nothing, and the only way to know was to grow them and look.

Harold set the stool in the row. The legs pressed into the soil, which was dark and damp from the morning's irrigation, and he sat down and his back curved forward and his hands came up to the level of the wheat and the wheat was at his chest, the heads heavy, the stems thick, and the plants surrounded him in their rows, the canopy closing over him so that he was inside it, inside the wheat, the heads at his eyes, the leaves brushing his arms.

He took the tweezers from his shirt pocket. He took the scissors. He took a head in his left hand, the fingers closing around the stem below the head, holding it steady, and the head was mature enough for crossing, the anthers inside the florets still green, still tight, the window open, and he began.

He trimmed the spikelets at the tip. Three of them, small and undeveloped, the scissors cutting cleanly, the trimmed pieces falling into the dirt. He trimmed the spikelets at the base, two of them, and the head was reduced to its middle section, the spikelets that would set the best seed. He opened the first floret with the tip of the tweezers, spreading the glumes, and inside were the anthers, three of them, pale green, each one a sac of pollen that would, if left, fertilize the pistil and produce a self-pollinated seed, a copy of the mother, and the work was to prevent this, to remove the anthers before they opened, to take the maleness out of the flower so that the femaleness could receive pollen from a different plant, a chosen plant, the father.

He pulled the first anther. The tweezers gripped the base of the sac and he drew it up and out of the floret and the anther came free, a small green thing, barely visible, and he dropped it into the dirt and reached for the next. The second anther. The third. He moved to the next floret and opened it and pulled the anthers, one, two, three, and then the next floret, and the head was being emptied of its pollen, floret by floret, the female parts left intact, the stigma and the ovary waiting, and when the head was done he fitted a paper bag over it, a small glassine bag, and twisted the end around the stem and the bag hung there, white against the green, protecting the emasculated head from any pollen but the pollen Harold would bring to it in two days, when the stigma was receptive, when the female was ready.

He reached for the next head. The row was long and the heads were many and the work was the same for each one, trim, open, pull, bag, the sequence repeating, the hands performing the motions they had learned twenty-six years ago in the Yaqui Valley when the heat was a wall and the mosquitoes circled and the stool was new and Harold was young and the wheat was a problem he had not yet solved. The wheat was still a problem. It was always a problem. The rust shifted and the varieties that resisted it had to shift with it, and the yield could always be higher and the protein could always be better and the adaptation could always be broader, and each cross was a question put to the plant, what can you become, what will you give me if I give you this father, this combination, this chance, and the answer came months later, in the next generation, in the field, in the data, and sometimes the answer was nothing and sometimes the answer was something and the work was to keep asking.

The sun moved. It rose above the mountains to the east and cleared the ridge and the light came down into the crossing block, the morning light of the high valley, thin and clear, without the weight of the Yaqui sun, a light that illuminated without pressing, and Harold worked in it, head after head, the tweezers and the scissors and the bags, and the wheat heads accumulated their white bags in a line along the row, each one a cross begun, a question asked.

His back ached. It had ached for years, the lower back, the curve that the stool had pressed into his spine over the decades, a permanent curvature that he carried even when standing, a slight forward lean that Ruth sometimes put her hand on when they walked, her palm flat on his lower back as if she could press the curve out of it, and the ache was there now, on the stool, the familiar ache, and he shifted his weight and the stool adjusted and the ache remained and he continued.

The morning passed. Ramirez came to the edge of the crossing block and reported that the aphids were confined to the border rows and that he had counted fourteen ladybirds in the interior, and Harold said leave it, the ladybirds would manage, and Ramirez left and Harold bent back to the wheat. A breeze came up from the valley and moved through the canopy and the heads swayed and Harold held the one he was working steady with his left hand and the breeze carried the smell of the soil, the dark irrigated soil, and the smell of the wheat itself, the green vegetal smell of a living crop, and somewhere in the valley a truck was moving on the road, the sound of its engine small and distant, and the mountains were there, the ring of them around the valley, the snow on the Nevado bright in the midday light.

He ate lunch on the stool. The thermos was empty and he drank water from the canteen and ate nothing because there was nothing to eat and it did not matter because the work was there and the work was enough. The afternoon light was different from the morning light, warmer, the angle lower, the shadows of the stakes and the strings falling in long lines across the rows, and Harold worked through it, the crosses continuing, the bags accumulating, the row advancing.

He thought about nothing. Not about Oslo, not about the phone call, not about what the prize meant or what it would require of him or what it said about the work. He thought about the head in his hand, the floret he was opening, the anthers he was pulling, and this thinking was not thinking in the usual sense but a kind of attention, a presence in the hands and the eyes that excluded everything else, the way it had always excluded everything else, the way it had excluded the telegram and the dead child and the absent wife and the institutional resistance and the fumigated seed, the attention narrowing to the point of the tweezers, to the anther, to the pull, and in that narrowing there was something that was not peace exactly, because peace was a word for a state he did not think about, but there was a fit, the hands and the tool and the plant fitted together, the body on the stool fitted to the work, and the fitting was sufficient, was the thing itself.

The afternoon went. The light changed. The shadows lengthened across the crossing block and the air cooled as the sun dropped toward the mountains to the west, and the wheat was golden in the late light, the heads catching it, the bags glowing white, and Harold pulled the last anther from the last head he would do today and fitted the bag over it and twisted the end and set it and looked up.

The valley was there. The fields stretching to the north, the road, the town, the mountains all around, and the sky was deepening toward the blue that comes before evening, the blue that is almost violet, the blue of altitude and thin air, and the wheat in the crossing block stood in its rows, the bagged heads in a line, the work of the day visible in the white paper against the green stems, each bag a cross, each cross a chance, each chance an unknown.

Harold sat on the stool. He did not get up. The tweezers were in his right hand and the scissors were in his left and the notebook was on his knee, the pages filled with the day's records, the cross numbers, the parent lines, the dates, the same records he had been keeping since the first season in the Yaqui Valley, the ledger of the work, and he sat there and the stool held him and the soil was under the stool and the wheat was around him and the mountains were around the wheat and the sky was above the mountains and the light was going and the air was cool and he sat there.

His hands rested on his knees. The tweezers in the right hand, the scissors in the left. The fingers thick and stiff, the knuckles swollen, the skin darkened and creased, the hands of a man who had spent twenty-six years holding small tools and small plants in the sun, and the hands rested and the stool held him and the day was ending.

He would drive back to the city. He would park the truck on the street and climb the stairs and come through the door and Ruth would be in the kitchen or in her chair, and she would have spent the day answering the telephone, and there would be messages, and the messages would be from people he would need to talk to and did not want to talk to, and the days ahead would be different from the days behind, the travel to Oslo, the ceremony, the speech he would have to write, the attention that would come and that he would have to accommodate, and all of this was ahead and none of it was here, on the stool, in the crossing block, where the wheat was the wheat and the work was the work and the tweezers were in his hand.

He sat a moment longer. The light was going. A bird crossed the valley low, its shadow moving across the plots faster than the bird itself, and the breeze had stilled and the wheat was motionless, the heads upright, the bags hanging, the rows ordered and quiet. The soil under the stool was dark. The mountains were dark against the sky. The day was done and the work would be here tomorrow, the heads that still needed to be crossed, the anthers that still needed to be pulled, the bags that still needed to be fitted, the next generation waiting inside the next cross, and the next after that, and the next, the work that did not end because the wheat did not end, because the rust shifted and the yield could be higher and the adaptation could be broader and there was always another head, another floret, another anther to pull, and Harold sat on the stool in the crossing block at Toluca with the tweezers in his hand and the mountains around him and the wheat around him and the evening coming on, and then he stood up, and folded the stool, and carried it back to the station, and set it against the wall where it would be tomorrow when he came back to sit on it again.
