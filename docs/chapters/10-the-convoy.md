# Chapter 10: The Convoy

The letter came from New Delhi. It arrived at the Foundation office in Mexico City and was forwarded to the station, where it sat in the mail tray on the counter for two days before Harold opened it, because Harold opened mail the way he opened mail, which was after the field work and after the notebooks and after the seed was sorted and labeled and stored, the mail being the last thing and the least urgent thing and the thing most likely to contain requests for reports or invitations to conferences or the other paper obligations that accumulated around the work like chaff around the threshing floor. He opened it at the table after dinner, the single page, typed on thin paper, the letterhead of an agricultural research institute, and the letter said that the writer had heard about the semi-dwarf wheat varieties developed in Mexico and wished to discuss the possibility of testing them in India, where the wheat harvests were failing and the population was growing and the old tall varieties could not be fertilized without falling over, the same problem, the same physics, the same ratio of stem to head to weight that Harold had solved in the Yaqui Valley, and the letter asked whether seed might be made available.

Harold read the letter twice. He folded it and put it in the ledger and closed the ledger and went outside and stood in the yard, where the evening light was coming in low and flat across the station buildings and the irrigation canal was running, the steady sound of it, and the air smelled of dust and of the creosote bushes along the canal bank, and he stood there with his hands in his pockets and the letter in the ledger and the ledger on the table inside.

More letters came. From Pakistan, from a man at a research station in the Punjab who had read a technical bulletin about the Mexican semi-dwarf varieties. From the Foundation office in New York, a memorandum saying that a delegation from the Indian government had inquired about the wheat program, the language layered with qualifications and contingencies, but the meaning underneath it plain: India was hungry, Pakistan was hungry, the harvests were not enough, and someone had heard that in a valley in northwestern Mexico there was wheat that stood up when you fed it.

Harold brought the letters to Vega and Vega read them, the Spanish of the Foundation memorandum and the English of the Indian letter, which Vega read slowly, his lips moving slightly, the English he had learned from Harold over twenty years imperfect but sufficient, and when he finished he looked at Harold and said nothing for a moment.

How much seed, Vega said.

Harold shook his head. He did not know yet. But the implication was there, in the word testing, which could mean a few hectares or a few hundred hectares or something larger than either of them had dealt with, and the distance between the station plots and a country he had never seen was a distance he could not calculate, not in kilometers but in seed, in the sheer quantity of grain that would be needed to plant fields at that scale, and the quantity was not in the tins on the shelf.

A man named Swaminathan came from India. He came to the station, a tall man with dark skin and careful English and a notebook of his own, and Harold walked him through the plots, the semi-dwarf varieties standing in their rows at waist height, the heads heavy, the stems thick, and Swaminathan bent and looked at the plants and touched the heads and pulled a stem and felt the stiffness of it and said nothing for a long time. At the end of the walk he stood at the edge of the field and looked out across the plots and the canal and the flat floor of the Yaqui Valley stretching to the mountains in the east, and he said that in India the wheat was tall and the farmers could not fertilize it without the plants falling over and that the population was growing by twelve million people a year and that the situation was, and here he paused, urgent.

Swaminathan wanted tons of seed. Enough to plant demonstration plots across the Indian wheat belt, thousands of hectares, the Punjab and Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, and the amount he described was an amount that did not exist, not yet, not in the storage shed, not in the tins, an amount that would have to be grown, multiplied, harvested, cleaned, sacked, shipped across an ocean. Pakistan wanted seed too, a separate request, a separate government, and the two countries were not speaking to each other, had fought a war, and the seed would have to go to both, separately, through different ports, the same wheat divided by politics.

The multiplication began that spring. Every available plot at the Yaqui station was planted with the semi-dwarf varieties, Pitic 62 and Penjamo 62 and Sonora 64 and the new line he was calling Lerma Rojo 64, and the plots were planted not for crossing, not for selection, not for the careful row-by-row evaluation that was the work of the stool, but for seed, for yield, for the maximum production of grain that could be harvested and cleaned and sacked and stored. Vega organized the planting crews, six men from the valley, and they planted with a mechanical seeder borrowed from the cooperativa, a rusted machine pulled behind the truck, the seed dropping into the furrows at a rate Harold had calculated on the back of an envelope, heavier than normal because the goal was not to evaluate the plants but to fill the bins. The plots at Toluca were planted the same way, Narvaez telephoning the station to report the germination, the stand count, and the number was good.

The station changed. For twenty years it had been organized around the stool, around the careful work of individual crosses, the tweezers and the scissors and the paper bags, the small precise labor that produced not grain but information, not yield but knowledge. Now the station was organized around production. The seed dryer ran all day, the motor grinding, the warm air blowing through the trays of harvested grain. The cleaning screens were set up in the yard, and the crew worked them by hand, shaking the wooden frames, the dust rising and settling on their arms and faces. The burlap sacks accumulated in the storage shed, stacked against the walls, labeled in Harold's handwriting with the variety name and the lot number and the date, and the stacks grew, the shed filling, the smell of clean dry grain thick in the enclosed space.

Harold still went to the stool. He went in the early mornings, before the production crews arrived, and he sat in the crossing block, the small plot at the south end of the station where he kept his breeding lines, the new crosses, the next generation, the work that could not stop, and he crossed for an hour or two, the tweezers in his hand, the notebook on his knee, and then he put the stool away and went to the production fields, where the work was not the stool but the scale.

The harvest came. The crews cut the multiplication plots by hand, the sickles flashing in the sun, the bundles tied and stacked in the field to dry, and the threshing took a week, the small machine running from dawn, the grain pouring into the sacks, the chaff blowing across the yard in clouds that stuck to the men's skin and worked into their eyes and ears. The Toluca harvest came a month later and Narvaez sent the seed south by truck, the sacks arriving dusty and road-worn, and Harold and Vega weighed and counted and recorded and the total grew, sack by sack, the number in the ledger climbing toward the number Swaminathan had written on the back of a napkin at dinner in Obregon, the number that had seemed impossible when he wrote it and that was now, sack by sack, becoming real.

The trucks were arranged through the cooperativa. Thirty trucks. Harold had never coordinated anything like it, had never thought in terms of trucks and loads and routes and schedules, and the arranging was done at a table in the cooperativa office in Obregon, Harold and Vega and a man named Garza who managed the fleet, the three of them bent over a map, the route from the Yaqui Valley south to the port at Guaymas marked in pencil, a hundred and thirty kilometers of valley road and then highway.

The loading took two days. The trucks lined up in the yard outside the storage shed, flatbeds and stake trucks and two enclosed vans, farm trucks used for hauling grain and cotton and hay, and the crews loaded the sacks by hand, two men in the shed lifting and two men on the truck stacking, the burlap sacks heavy, forty kilograms each, the weight of them pulling at the shoulders and the lower back, and the men worked in the heat, the sweat darkening their shirts, the dust from the burlap coating their hands and arms, and the sacks went up onto the trucks and were stacked three deep and tied down with ropes and the trucks settled on their springs as the weight accumulated.

Harold stood at the edge of the yard and watched. The seed in the sacks was the seed he had made, not directly, not head by head, but through the crosses and the selections and the years on the stool, the lineage traceable back through the notebooks to the first crosses with the Norin 10 material, the small brown seed that had arrived in an envelope from Washington, and from there through the Mexican varieties he had built over the preceding decade, and from there back to the beginning, to the ruined station and the rats and the first wheat head he had taken in his hand in this valley, and all of it was in the sacks, compressed into grain, packed into burlap and loaded onto flatbeds, and the trucks idled in the yard and the exhaust rose in the still air and the loading continued.

Vega supervised the tying. He walked from truck to truck, checking the ropes, pulling the knots, pressing his hand against the stacked sacks to feel for movement, the same attention he had brought to the work since the day the boy had picked up the scissors, applied now not to a single wheat head but to thirty trucks.

They left before dawn. Harold stood on the road outside the station gate and the trucks came past him one by one, the headlights cutting the darkness, the engines laboring under the weight, and Vega was in the cab of the lead truck beside Garza, and the trucks came past, one after another, the intervals close, the line stretching back along the road, and the sound of them was the sound of thirty diesel engines and thirty sets of tires on the packed dirt and the creak of the springs and the shift of the loads, and the dust rose in the headlights and hung in the air behind each truck so that the trucks behind drove through the dust of the trucks ahead, and Harold stood and watched them pass, all thirty, the last one's taillights shrinking down the road until the road was empty and the dust was settling and the sound was fading and the station was quiet.

He went inside and poured coffee and sat at the table and the station was empty in a way it had not been empty for months, the crews gone, Vega gone, the storage shed empty, the yard churned by the tires, and Harold sat with his coffee and the ledger open in front of him, the page recording the shipment, the number of sacks and the variety and the weight and the date, and the page was a page in a ledger and the seed was on the road.

The seed did not leave Mexico easily. There were phytosanitary certificates, documents attesting that the seed was free of disease and pest, and the certificates required inspections, a man from the Ministry of Agriculture who did not come on the day he was supposed to come. The trucks waited at the port. The seed sat in a warehouse at the dock, the sacks stacked on pallets, the warehouse hot and airless, and Harold telephoned Vega at the port and Vega said the seed was fine, the seed was fine, but the waiting continued. The Mexican government was reluctant. The seed had been developed in Mexico, with Mexican resources, in Mexican fields, and there were people in the Ministry who believed the seed should stay in Mexico, that sending it abroad was giving away what the country had paid for, and this argument had a logic Harold could see without agreeing with it, the logic of a country that had been hungry and had become self-sufficient and did not want to give away the thing that had made it so. Harold sat in offices in Hermosillo and spoke on the telephone to officials in Mexico City and the conversations were the conversations of bureaucracy, imprecise where the field was precise, conditional where the field was absolute, and the seed sat in the warehouse.

The permits came piecemeal, one stamp at a time, and when the last stamp was on the last form Harold drove to the port and watched the sacks loaded onto the ship, the crane lifting the pallets from the dock, the sacks swinging in the net, the pallets settling into the hold, and the loading took most of a day, and Harold stood on the dock and watched and the sun was on the water and the gulls were circling and the ship sat low in the harbor with the weight of the grain.

The ship left. Harold watched it pull away from the dock, the water widening between the hull and the pilings, and then it was past the breakwater, in the open water, the Gulf of California, and Harold watched until the ship was a shape on the horizon and then a mark and then nothing, and he turned and walked back to the truck and drove back to the station.

The Foundation sent him. There was a ticket, a flight, Mexico City to New Delhi with a stop in London, and Harold packed a bag at the apartment while Ruth watched from the doorway of the bedroom, her arms crossed, and she did not say what she was thinking, which Harold could see in her face, the tightness at the corners of her mouth, the posture of a woman who had watched her husband leave for the field a thousand times and who was now watching him leave for a different kind of distance, a distance that could not be measured in the hours of a bus ride, and she handed him a clean shirt and said to eat on the plane.

The flight was long. Harold sat by the window and the land below changed, the brown of Mexico becoming the green and gray of the eastern United States and then the black of the Atlantic, the plane droning, the cabin dim, and Harold did not sleep, or slept the way he slept on the bus, briefly, the head dropping and jerking up, and the hours passed. London was rain and a terminal and three hours of waiting. Then the plane again, east, and the plane descended toward New Delhi in the late afternoon and the city appeared below, vast and brown and hazy, the buildings stretching in every direction, and the plane landed and the doors opened and the air came in.

The heat was different from Mexico's heat. Harold stood on the tarmac and the air was heavy with moisture, thick, the kind of air that coats the skin and sits in the lungs, and the smell was different, a compound of exhaust and dust and something vegetal and sweet he could not identify, and the light was different too, filtered through a haze that was not cloud and not dust but something between, a permanent suspension that softened the edges of everything and gave the light a quality that was almost golden but not clean, not the sharp gold of the Yaqui Valley evening but a diffuse warmth that seemed to come from everywhere. He walked into the terminal and the terminal was crowded in a way he had not experienced, people moving in every direction, the voices overlapping in languages he did not recognize, and the people around him pressed close, the space between bodies smaller than he was used to, the density of human presence a physical fact, and Harold stood in the customs line and waited and the sweat ran down his back under the clean shirt Ruth had given him.

Swaminathan met him outside the terminal and they drove north, out of the city and onto the plain, and the land opened up and flattened and the fields appeared, wheat fields, the wheat growing in plots that stretched to the horizon, the plants tall, chest-high, the heads thin, the stems pale and slender, and the fields were the fields of a country that grew wheat the way Mexico had grown wheat twenty years ago, the old varieties, the tall stems, the low yields, and the farmers were in the fields, bent over, working with hand tools, hoes and sickles, the shapes of their bodies in the wheat the shapes of people who had always worked this way, stooped, slow, the sun on their backs.

The car stopped at a research station outside a town Harold could not pronounce. Low buildings around a courtyard, whitewashed, the roofs flat, and plots behind the buildings, and Harold got out and stretched and the road dust was on his clothes and in his hair and the air was warm and dry here, drier than Delhi, the Punjab winter. Harold walked the plots the way he walked any field, slowly, bending to look at the plants, touching the stems, pulling a head and rubbing the spikelets between his fingers, the motion automatic, the fingers assessing the grain the way they had assessed grain ten thousand times, and the wheat was tall and the stems were thin and the heads were light and the rust was on some of the lower leaves, the orange-brown pustules on the leaf surface, the fungus he had been fighting since his first year in Mexico, and he rubbed a pustule between his thumb and forefinger and the spores came off on his skin, the faint orange dust, and he wiped his hand on his trousers and moved to the next row.

The soil was different. Sandy in places, clay in others, the color lighter than the Yaqui Valley soil, and the irrigation was different, canal water distributed through shallow ditches, the system old, built on infrastructure that went back centuries, and the fields were smaller, divided into plots that a family could work, half a hectare, a hectare, the boundaries marked by low earthen bunds. Harold carried a notebook. He wrote in it the things he saw, the plant height and the stem diameter and the tiller count and the condition of the leaves and the presence or absence of rust, the same observations he made in his own fields, the same eye, and the notebook filled with the data of this new place, and the data were the data of a wheat crop that was producing a fraction of what the land and the water and the sun could support, the pattern familiar, the tall stems and the thin heads and the lodging and the rust, the same pattern he had spent twenty years solving, present here in different soil under a different sky.

They drove to Pakistan. Across the border, the formalities, the stamps and the papers, and the land was the same land, the Punjab on both sides, the same flat alluvial plain, the same canals, the same wheat, and the border was a line on a map that the wheat did not recognize and the soil did not recognize and the rust did not recognize.

The seed arrived at the port and was moved by train and by truck to the stations, and at each station the sacks were opened and the germination was tested and the germination rate was lower than Harold wanted, lower than it should have been, and he stood in the seed testing room and looked at the germination trays, the blotting paper with the seed laid out in rows, some of the seeds sprouted and green and some of them dark and still, dead, and his jaw tightened and he asked about the fumigation and was told that the customs authority had fumigated the shipment upon arrival, heavier than necessary, and the chemical had killed a portion of the seed.

Harold stood in the room with the trays. The men around him were quiet. He looked at the dead seeds and the living seeds and he calculated, the way he calculated yields and seeding rates and fertilizer applications, and what he calculated was that the living seed was enough, barely, if they doubled the seeding rate, planted twice as much per hectare, compensating for the dead with the surplus of the living. He said this plainly, directly, the calculation made and the solution offered, and the solution was not elegant but it was the solution, and the seed was there, in the sacks, and the planting could proceed.

The planting proceeded. Not Harold's hands. Not his stool. The seed was distributed to the stations and from the stations to the farmers, measured out at the doubled rate, and the farmers took the seed and looked at it the way Delgado had looked at it in the Yaqui Valley, the weight in the palm, the feel between the fingers, wheat seed, small and brown and hard, and they planted it alongside their old varieties, the short wheat next to the tall, the seed broadcast into prepared beds and worked into the soil by hand, with hoes and rakes, and the seed went into the ground in fields that stretched across the Punjab, Indian and Pakistani, the same seed in the same soil on both sides of the line that the wheat did not know.

Harold stood at the edge of a field in the Punjab. The field was a quarter hectare, bounded by earthen bunds, and a man and his two sons were planting, the man walking slowly along the prepared rows, his hand dipping into the canvas bag at his hip and coming out with seed and scattering it in the row, the motion fluid, rhythmic, the arm swinging in an arc, the seed leaving the hand in a spray that caught the low sun, and the sons followed behind with hoes, covering the seed, pressing it into the soil, and the three of them moved together down the rows, the father and the sons, their shadows long in the afternoon light, and the field was one field among thousands and the seed was the seed that had come from the Yaqui Valley, from the station, from the crosses Harold had made on the stool, from the tweezers and the scissors and the paper bags, from the years, and the seed was here now, in this man's hand, in this field, in this country Harold had not known, going into soil Harold had never touched, planted by hands that were not his, and the distance between the stool and this field was the distance the work had traveled, and Harold did not measure it, Harold watched the man plant, the hand dipping and the seed scattering and the sons covering it, and the evening light lay on the field and the soil was dark where the water had been and pale where it had not, and the man did not look at Harold, the man planted, and his sons planted, and the seed went into the ground.
