# Chapter 5: The Marriages

By nineteen fifty-one the field had a sound. Not the sound of one man working, which was almost no sound at all, but the sound of twelve people working in wheat at the same time, spread across the rows in a loose formation that shifted as the morning went on, each person moving at his own pace down his own row, and the sound of it was cumulative, layered, the snip of scissors overlapping with the rustle of paper bags overlapping with the low murmur of voices that rose and fell without ever becoming conversation, because they were not talking to each other, they were talking to the work, to themselves, the half-words and grunts and quiet exclamations that come out of a body that is concentrating, and Harold, sitting on the stool at the center of it, could hear all of it the way a man standing in a kitchen can hear the separate sounds of water boiling and oil heating and a knife on a board, each one distinct but part of a single larger thing that was the field at work, the program at full speed, the morning underway.

Vega ran the east section. He had his own boys now, four of them, boys he had trained himself using methods that were not exactly Harold's methods but were close enough that the results were the same, and he moved among them in the early light with a clipboard that he held the way Harold held his notebook, tucked under his arm when both hands were needed, produced and consulted and tucked away again in a motion so practiced it had become invisible, part of the body's repertoire the way breathing was, and Harold watched him sometimes from across the rows, not watching him exactly but aware of him, the way you are aware of someone who is doing what you would be doing if you were in his place, and what he saw was a man who no longer needed to be taught, who had absorbed the work so completely that it came out of him as naturally as speech, and Harold did not think about what this meant for the future of the program or for the larger project or for anything beyond the day, he simply noted it, the way he noted the condition of the heads and the color of the stems and the moisture in the soil, a fact in the field, recorded and filed.

The boys called the crosses marriages. This had started years ago, when Rupert told them to think of it that way, the mother plant and the father plant and the seed that came from bringing them together, and the word had taken hold and spread and become the language of the program, so that when Tomás finished a cross he would announce it as a wedding, holding up the bagged head and saying something to the others that Harold's Spanish was now good enough to follow, the bride is ready, or the groom has arrived, and the other boys would respond with jokes that Harold did not always catch but that made them laugh, and the laughter moved through the rows and Harold let it move because laughter in a field at that temperature was a kind of fuel, it kept the bodies going when the heat alone would have stopped them.

The speed was the thing that had changed most. In the early years Harold had managed forty crosses in a good day, working alone, and this had seemed like a lot because most breeders in the United States and Europe were managing fewer than two hundred in a year, working with glass greenhouses and controlled environments and technicians who held advanced degrees. By fifty-one the program was completing six thousand crosses a year. The number was in the ledger, verified, and Harold had written it down the way he wrote everything down, without commentary, a figure at the bottom of a column, but the figure represented the daily reality of twelve people working from the time the light was strong enough to see the anthers until the time the light failed, which in the Yaqui Valley meant thirteen hours, fourteen in the long days of spring, and the crosses accumulated the way water fills a tank, drop by drop, the level rising so slowly you could not see it move but could measure the difference at the end of the day.

Harold worked his row. The stool was the same stool, repaired twice, the seat worn to a shine that was almost white, the three legs so familiar to his weight that they had settled into the earth at the same angle every morning, three small divots in the hard-packed soil that were the first marks of the day. He sat and his back curved and his hands came up and the scissors were in his left hand and the tweezers in his right and the first head of the morning was in front of him, a cross he had planned the night before, the mother a Kenyan variety with good rust resistance and the father a local Sonoran line that matured early, and he trimmed the spikelets at the tip, two of them, and two at the base, and then he cut down the sides of each remaining spikelet the way Vega had shown him, the scissors opening the glume entirely so the interior was exposed, and he reached in with the tweezers and pulled the anthers in a single motion, three at once, the technique that had come from a boy squatting in the dirt five years ago and that was now the standard method, the way everyone in the program did it, and Harold did it too, his thicker fingers less fluid than Vega's but practiced enough that the motion was clean, two seconds per floret, and he moved to the next.

The Hernandez brothers worked the rows to his left. There were three of them now, the two who had come in the first year and a younger one who had followed, and they had developed their own system, one trimming, one emasculating, one bagging, an assembly line that moved through the heads faster than any one person could, and Harold had seen this and said nothing about it because it worked. Arturo was the youngest, seventeen, and he was different from his brothers. The older two worked with the competence of men who performed their training faithfully. But Arturo asked questions, not about how to do the work but about why, why this mother and not that one, why these traits were sought and others were not, and Harold answered them briefly, pointing at the plants, showing the rust on a susceptible stem and the clean stem of a resistant one, and Arturo listened with the same intensity that Vega had listened with years ago, the same quality of attention that was not just hearing but absorbing. Harold had written to Stakman about the boy, asked whether the Foundation might support his education, and Stakman had written back and said he would look into it, and Harold had put the letter in the drawer and gone back to the field.

The heat built through the morning the way it always built, in stages that were marked not by the clock but by the body, the first sweat at the temples, the wetness spreading across the back of the shirt, the moment when the ground began to radiate and the air above the rows shimmered and the wheat heads seemed to float in the distortion, and then the full heat, the heat that was no longer a temperature but a condition, a medium they all worked inside. At midday they stopped, not because Harold believed in stopping but because the heat between noon and two made the fine work impossible, the sweat dripping from the forehead onto the wheat heads, the hands slipping on the tweezers, and the work that was done in those hours was sloppy work, crosses that would fail because an anther had been crushed or a bag had been sealed with wet fingers that weakened the paper, and so they stopped, and the boys gathered in the shade of the station and ate.

Tortillas and beans, sometimes rice, sometimes a piece of fruit, and they ate with the slow deliberation of people who have been working since dawn and who will work again until dark. Tomás talked while he ate. He told stories or made observations or described something he had seen on the road that morning, a dog, a girl, a truck with a load so tall it scraped the branches of the trees along the canal, and the other boys listened or did not listen and ate their food, and Harold sat apart from them, not far, ten feet, on an overturned crate by the door of the station, eating his own lunch, and he ate and listened to the boys without entering their conversation because he was not part of their conversation, was not part of their world in the way they were part of each other's, and he knew this and it was not a problem, it was simply the arrangement, each person in his place, the work connecting them without requiring them to be the same.

Vega ate alone too. He sat at the far end of the wall, his back against the concrete, his hat over his face, and whether he was sleeping or thinking or simply resting Harold could not tell and did not try to tell. They had worked together for seven years and in that time they had developed a way of being near each other that required almost no speech, a language of gesture and glance that was sufficient for everything the work demanded, a nod toward a row that needed attention, a lifted hand to indicate that a particular cross was ready for pollination, and this was not intimacy in any sense Harold would have recognized, but it was something, a form of knowing that existed in the body, in the way his hands moved when Vega was nearby and the way they moved differently when he was not, a confidence that came from the presence of someone who understood the work at the same depth he did, and Harold did not think about this because thinking about it would have meant naming it and naming it would have changed it into something it was not.

Vega's hands were the best in the program. This was not an opinion but a fact, measurable in the number of crosses completed per hour, in the percentage that took, in the clean precision of the emasculations. His hands were thinner than Harold's and darker, the fingers long and slightly curved, and they moved through the florets with a fluidity that Harold's hands had never achieved and would never achieve, because Harold's hands had been shaped by other work, the Iowa work, the hay bales and the fence posts and the milking, and the thickness of them was permanent, written into the bone, and his precision, which was considerable, was the precision of compensation, of thick fingers learning to be delicate, while Vega's precision was native, was the starting point rather than the destination, and the difference between them was the difference between a man who had learned a language in adulthood and a man who had been born into it, both fluent, both capable, but one of them thinking in it and the other translating.

Harold had demanded that the boys be paid. This was a thing he had done two years back, a meeting on Londres Street where he had told Harrar that the senior technicians were to be paid at the same rate as college graduates, and Harrar had said this was not possible, that they did not have degrees, that the pay scale was the pay scale, and Harold had said that the pay scale was wrong, that these men were doing work that no college graduate could do, and Harold had been patient in the way he was patient about everything, which was a patience that did not yield, that sat still and waited for the obstacle to move because it would move, it always moved, because Harold would be there longer than the obstacle would, and eventually Harrar had agreed, not happily, and the boys, who were no longer boys, who were men in their twenties now with families of their own, were paid what they were worth, or closer to it.

The afternoon work began when the shadow of the station reached the first row. This was the signal, not spoken, not agreed upon, but understood by everyone, the shadow touching the edge of the field and the boys standing and brushing off their trousers and walking back to their rows and picking up their tools, and the work resumed, the same work as the morning, the same motions, the same sounds, the field filling again with the layered noise of twelve people making crosses.

On Saturdays Harold coached baseball. There was a field behind the school in the village, a flat patch of dirt with no grass and no fence and bases that were squares of cardboard weighted with stones, and the boys, a different set of boys, younger, ten and eleven and twelve, came in the late afternoon when the worst of the heat had passed and they played until the light was gone. The team was called the Aguilas, and they wore whatever clothes they had, cotton trousers and undershirts, some of them with shoes and some without, and they played baseball on a dirt field in the Yaqui Valley because Harold had taught them to play. He had learned the game in Iowa, and his body still remembered it, and he taught the way his father had taught him to do anything, through the body, through demonstration, through doing it beside them until they could do it themselves. He stood behind the batter and put his hands over the boy's hands on the bat and showed him the motion, the rotation of the hips and the extension of the arms, and the boy felt the motion because Harold's body was doing it with him, and then Harold stepped back and the boy did it alone, or tried to, and if it was wrong Harold stepped in again and they did it again.

He did not talk much during practice. He said good when something was good and said nothing when it was not and showed the correct way by doing it, and the boys learned from this silence the way boys learn from all silence, by watching, by copying, by the slow absorption of the body's knowledge into their own bodies, and Harold did not know that this was the way his father had been with him, that the absence of speech was not a method he had chosen but a pattern he was repeating, and that the boys who stood at the cardboard bases and caught the ball and threw it back were receiving from him the same thing he had received from his father, which was the knowledge of the body passed from one body to another in the space where words would have been if words had been available, and they were not available, not to his father and not to him, and so the space was filled with the work itself, the throw, the catch, the swing, and this was enough. Tomás's boy was the pitcher, eleven, left-handed, with a throwing motion that was all arm and no body, the way children throw before they are taught otherwise, and Harold worked with him, standing behind him, showing him how to push off, how to rotate, how to let the arm follow the body rather than lead it, and when the boy threw a good one, when the ball went where it was supposed to go with something behind it, the boy looked at Harold and Harold nodded and that was enough.

There was a Boy Scout troop too. On certain evenings Harold sat with the boys in a circle outside the station and taught them knots and map reading and the names of the stars, the rope in his hands, the motions deliberate, the knot forming, and then their hands, the rope passed around the circle, each boy trying it, fumbling, trying again, and Harold sitting there among them, patient, watching their hands. He did not think about what he was doing. He was coaching baseball. He was leading a scout troop. He was doing the things that a man does in a community, and if there was something else beneath the surface of these activities, a man teaching boys the way he wished he had been taught, a man being present in the way his father had not been present, a man filling a space that existed in him without his knowledge of it, this was not something Harold knew or would have recognized if someone had told him, because the surface was the thing he lived on, the surface of the work and the surface of the day, and what was beneath it was beneath it.

Harold sat on the stool in the late afternoon and worked a cross that required his full attention, a difficult one, the mother a variety from India with heads so small the spikelets were almost too tiny to work with, the glumes tight against the anthers, and he held the head steady with his left hand and used the scissors to open the first spikelet and the interior was so narrow the tweezers barely fit, and he turned them sideways and reached in and felt the anther with the tips of the forceps, a tiny green sac the size of a grain of sand, and he grasped it and pulled and it came free, intact, the filament separating cleanly, and he set it on his knee and reached for the next. The light was coming in low now, from the west, and it caught the wheat head and the interior of the floret was lit from the side, the structures visible in sharp detail, the pale walls of the glume and the thin filaments and the small anthers and at the center the pistil, the stigma slightly sticky, not yet receptive, still waiting, and Harold worked inside this space with a care that was not gentleness but something more exact, an awareness of the boundaries, of how much pressure was too much, of the precise angle at which the tweezers could enter without touching the walls, and his breathing slowed and his body was still and the only motion was in his fingers, and the field around him had gone quiet because the other workers were finishing their rows and the birds had settled and the canal was low and slow in the late heat, and Harold was alone with the cross, the mother plant in his hand, the father pollen in a glassine envelope in his shirt pocket, waiting for tomorrow or the next day when the stigma would be ready and he would open the bag and introduce the pollen and close the bag and the marriage would be made.

He did not use that word. The boys used it. But the work of it, the bringing together, the careful preparation and the waiting and the moment of joining and the longer waiting that followed, the days with the bag sealed over the head while inside it something was or was not happening, the combination of two lines into something that had not existed before, this was the thing he knew better than he knew anything else, better than he knew Ruth or his children or his own face in the mirror, because he had done it ten thousand times and each time it was the same and each time it was different, the same motions of the hands producing a different result because the plants were different, the weather was different, the day was different, and what came out of each cross was unknown until it was planted and grown and tested, and this not-knowing was the thing that kept him on the stool, the thing that brought him back each morning, the possibility that inside this bag, this one, the one he was sealing now with his thick careful fingers, something was beginning that would matter.

The light changed. It went from white to gold to the deep amber that came just before sunset, and the field was in shadow now, the rows darkened, the wheat heads catching the last light at their tips, and Harold sealed the bag and wrote the cross number on it with the pencil stub and stood up from the stool and his back straightened in stages, vertebra by vertebra, the way it did every evening, the ache in his lower spine releasing slowly as his body remembered its full height, and he picked up the stool and carried it under one arm and walked back to the station, where the lantern was already lit and the evening was beginning.

He wrote in the ledger. The day's crosses, each one a line, the cross number and the date and the varieties and the name of the person who had made it, and the lines filled the page and the page was turned and the next page began to fill, and the ledger was the fifth one that year, the others stacked on the shelf above the seed tins, and the record grew the way the work grew, steadily, without interruption, each entry a fact that would outlast the day that produced it. He wrote in his careful hand and the lantern made a circle of light on the table and the station was quiet and the night sounds were beginning outside, the insects, the canal, the distant dogs, and somewhere in the village Tomás's boy was throwing a ball against a wall, the push and the rotation Harold had shown him, and in the east section of the field the bags that Vega had sealed that day were holding their crosses in the dark, the pollen and the stigma meeting or not meeting, the seed forming or not forming, the work continuing inside the paper the way all work continues, silently, without an audience, in the dark.

He closed the ledger and set the pencil down and turned the lantern low and went up to the loft. The cot was the same cot, the mattress thinner now, his body's shape worn into it the way the stool had his body's shape worn into it, and he lay down and the springs received him and the ceiling was close above him and the tin roof was still warm. He thought about the cross he had been working at the end of the day, the Indian variety with the small heads, and whether the stigma would be ready tomorrow or whether it would need another day, and this was what he thought about, this was what occupied the space in his mind that in other men might have been occupied by other things, and he did not know this about himself, did not know that the wheat was where he kept what could not be kept elsewhere, that the crosses were the place where he was most fully present, most entirely himself, where the compartments that divided his life fell away and there was only the head in his hand and the anther between the tweezers and the work that connected him to the field and to the boys and to the thing they were building together, which was not a thing any of them could see but which was there, in the seed, in the bag, in the dark, growing.
