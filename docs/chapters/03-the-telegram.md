# Chapter 3: The Telegram

The mornings had become the same morning. Coffee on the kerosene stove in the dark, the flame catching blue and steady, the water heating in the dented pot while he pulled on his boots. The stiffness in his back was so familiar now it was less pain than signature, his body's way of confirming the day before had happened and the day ahead would be the same. He drank his coffee standing by the canal. The water was black at that hour, not yet reflecting anything, just moving, and the air was cool for those twenty minutes before the sun came over the mountains and the heat began its work.

He carried the stool out to the plots and sat and the stool received his weight and the day began. The scissors, the tweezers, the first head. Four months he had been here, and the number was not something he thought but something his body knew, in the way the stool fit him now, in the deep brown of his forearms, in the permanent squint the sun had pressed into the skin around his eyes. Vega arrived before the other boys, as he always did, appearing at the edge of the field while the light was still low, squatting in his row without greeting, picking up his tweezers from where he had left them wrapped in a piece of cloth under a rock. The sound of the two of them working was very small, the snip of scissors, the pull of an anther from a floret, the rustle of a paper bag being fitted over a head, and these sounds were absorbed into the larger sounds of the field, the birds, the canal, the wind in the wheat.

He wrote to Ruth on Sundays. The letters were factual, organized around the work. He asked about Jeanie. He asked about the pregnancy. Ruth was due in early November, and the letters that came back from Wilmington described the ordinary difficulties of carrying a child in a small apartment with a toddler, the tiredness, the swollen ankles, and Harold read them in the evening at the table in the station and felt the distance between them not as miles but as a kind of thickness, a medium through which her voice traveled slowly and arrived changed, so that by the time he knew she was tired she was tired in a different way, and his response would arrive equally late, and the whole exchange had the quality of two people calling to each other across a wide field, their words reaching each other only after the moment that produced them had already passed.

November came and the heat did not change. In Iowa November meant the first cold, the ground hardening, the light going thin and gray, but here November was the same as October, which had been the same as September, the sun white and relentless, the dust rising from the roads behind every truck and cart. The wheat was maturing. The first crosses were setting seed, the paper bags swelling slightly as the grain formed inside, and Harold opened them carefully, one at a time, peeling back the paper to see the head, the seeds fat and tight in their glumes, and he recorded the results in his notebook, the cross number, the date, the number of seeds, their size, their color, and when a cross had failed, the head empty or the seeds shriveled and dark, he recorded that too, because the failures were data and the data was the work.

The telegram came on a Thursday. A man drove out from Obregon in a truck that Harold heard before he saw it, the engine laboring on the unpaved road, the sound rising above the noise of the field and the birds and the boys, and Harold looked up from his row and watched the truck come down the road and slow and stop by the station. The man got out. He was someone Harold had seen before, one of the clerks from the telegraph office in town, a small man in a white shirt with a leather bag over his shoulder, and he stood by the truck and looked around the yard as if unsure of where to go, and then he saw Harold in the field and walked toward him, picking his way between the irrigation furrows, the bag bumping against his hip.

Harold stood up from the stool. He did this without deciding to, the way you stand when someone is approaching, and he stood there with the tweezers still in his right hand and the scissors in his left and watched the man come across the field. The man said something in Spanish, Harold's name, or a version of it, and held out a piece of paper, a yellow form folded once, and Harold took it and the man nodded and turned and walked back the way he had come, through the furrows, across the yard, to his truck, and Harold heard the engine start and the truck pull away and the sound of it fading down the road.

He looked at the paper. It was a standard telegraph form, the kind with the printed border and the lines for the address and the message, and the message had been typed in capital letters by someone at the telegraph office, transcribed from whatever had come over the wire, and Harold read it. Ruth had given birth to a boy on November seventh. The baby had been born with spina bifida. Ruth and the baby were at the hospital. The telegram was from Ruth's mother.

He read it again. The words were the same. He folded the paper along its original crease and put it in his shirt pocket, the pocket where he kept his notebook and his pencil stub, and he stood there in the row with the tweezers in his hand and the wheat around him and the sun on his back and the sounds of the field continuing, the boys in their rows, the birds, the canal, Vega somewhere behind him working a cross, all of it continuing, and he stood there.

He sat back down on the stool. He did not decide to do this either. His body lowered itself onto the stool and his back curved forward and his hands came up and he was looking at the wheat head he had been working on when the truck arrived, the half-emasculated head with its trimmed spikelets, the anthers still inside the remaining florets, and he reached in with the tweezers and pulled one. It came free. He reached for the next. His hand was steady. The anther was very small and very green and he grasped it at its base and pulled and it separated from the filament cleanly, and he set it aside and reached for the next.

He worked for an hour. The hour passed the way all the hours passed, in the small motions of the hands, the scissors and the tweezers and the bags, head after head, and what was different was nothing visible, nothing in the movement of his hands or the position of his body on the stool or the sound of his work in the field. What was different was inside, and it was not a feeling he could have described because it was not a feeling in the way that word is usually meant, not an emotion with a name, grief or fear or sorrow, but a physical change, a pressure in his chest that had not been there before, a tightness in the muscles of his jaw, a sensation in his throat like something caught there that could neither be swallowed nor expelled, and these things were in his body and his body continued to work and the work continued and the afternoon went on.

He told Rupert at the end of the day. They were in the station, the light going gold through the windows, and Harold said it plainly, Ruth had a boy, the boy had spina bifida, and Rupert looked at him and said nothing for a while and then said, what do you need. Harold said he needed to get to Wilmington. Rupert said he would drive to Obregon in the morning and find out about flights. Harold nodded. They ate dinner, rice and beans and a can of sardines that Rupert opened with his knife, and they ate in silence, and the silence was not uncomfortable because it had never been uncomfortable between them, but it was different now, it had a weight it had not had before, and Harold could feel Rupert not saying things, the questions accumulating on the other side of the quiet, and he was grateful that Rupert did not ask them.

There were no flights for three days. Rupert came back from Obregon with this information and delivered it the way he delivered all information, flatly, without apology or elaboration. The next flight from Obregon to Mexico City was Saturday. From Mexico City he could get a flight to the east coast, probably to Washington or New York, and from there a train to Wilmington. Three days.

Harold worked. There was nothing else to do with the three days and so he worked. He carried the stool out and sat on it and crossed wheat. The telegram was in his shirt pocket, he could feel the stiff edge of it against his chest when he leaned forward, and the words were in his mind, not as a thought he was thinking but as a fact he was carrying, the way you carry the knowledge of your own name. His son. He had a son and the son had been born with a condition Harold knew the name of but did not understand, a failure of the spine to close, an opening in the back where the vertebrae had not fused, and what this meant for the child he did not know, and the not knowing was part of what he carried, a blankness where knowledge should have been, and he sat on the stool and pulled anthers and the blankness was there and the work was there and they occupied the same space in him without resolution.

He did not write to Ruth. A letter would take weeks. A telephone call would require driving to Obregon and placing the call through the operator, and even then what would he say. He would say I am coming. He would say that and nothing else, and Ruth would hear his voice and know he had received the telegram, and the rest, the questions about the baby, about what the doctors had said, about what could be done, these would wait until he was there, in the room, where the words could be spoken into air rather than typed onto paper.

The nights were the worst part. The days had the work, which was something to do with the hands and the body, something that occupied the mind at the level of the task, the anther, the tweezers, the bag, and this occupation was sufficient to hold the other thing at a distance, not gone but held, the way you hold a door closed against a pressure on the other side. But at night, in the loft, on the cot, the work stopped and the holding stopped and the pressure came through. He lay on his back and looked at the ceiling and the tin roof above him radiated the stored heat of the day and the mosquitoes circled against the netting and the sounds of the building were the same as they had always been, the mice, the wind, the creaking wood, and he lay there and the pressure was in his chest and in his throat and behind his eyes, a physical thing, something the body was doing that the mind had no say in, and he breathed and the breathing was harder than it should have been, as if the air had thickened, as if there were less of it in the room, and he lay still and let it be what it was because there was nothing else to do with it.

He thought about his father. Not deliberately, but the way his father appeared whenever the ordinary pattern of the days was broken, his face coming up from somewhere below the work the way a stone comes up in a plowed field. His father standing in the barn doorway, early morning, the light behind him so that his features were dark and his shape was just a shape, a man in a doorway, looking out at the yard where something had happened, a calf born dead or a fence down, and he stood there and looked at it and then he went out and dealt with it, and what Harold remembered was not what his father did but the moment before, the standing and looking, the brief pause in which the thing was acknowledged and then the body moving forward, and there had been no visible emotion in that pause, no sighing or cursing or shaking of the head, just the pause, and then the going.

On the second day Vega came and squatted beside Harold's row and worked in silence for an hour and then stood and walked to his own row and continued there. He had not looked at Harold. He had not said anything. He had simply been there, working beside him, the way he was there every day, and Harold did not know whether the boy knew about the telegram or whether this was just what Vega did, come to Harold's row and work, and it did not matter which it was because the effect was the same, the presence of another person working beside you, the sound of someone else's hands in the wheat, and this was enough, this was what there was.

The third morning Harold packed a bag. A change of clothes, his shaving kit, his notebook. He left the tweezers and the scissors on the shelf beside the seed tins and wrote instructions for Rupert and the boys in the ledger, which crosses to continue, which plots to water, when to open the bags. He wrote them in the clean hand he used for records and closed the ledger and set the pencil down.

Rupert drove him to the airfield. It was outside Obregon, a flat strip of packed earth with a tin-roofed shed at one end that served as a terminal, and there was a plane on the strip, a small twin-engine aircraft that flew the mail route to Mexico City, and Harold got out of the truck and stood there with his bag and Rupert said I'll keep it going. Harold nodded. They did not shake hands. Rupert got back in the truck and drove away and Harold carried his bag to the shed and waited.

The flight was loud and cold at altitude and he sat in a seat that vibrated against his back and looked out the window at the desert below, the brown expanse of it, the mountains to the east, the thin threads of rivers and irrigation canals, and then the land rose and greened and they were over the central plateau and he could see fields, real fields, planted and ordered, and then Mexico City in its valley, the buildings and the haze and the sprawl of it, and the plane descended and landed and he got off and found the terminal and waited again, three hours this time, for the flight north.

He arrived in Wilmington in the evening. Ruth's mother met him at the station and drove him to the hospital and did not say much on the drive, a few things about the baby, the weight, the doctors' names, practical information delivered in a practical voice, and Harold listened and looked out the window at the streets of Wilmington, the brick buildings and the elms and the streetlights coming on in the dusk, the same streets he had walked when he worked at the DuPont laboratory, all of it the same and none of it the same.

Ruth was in a room on the third floor. She was sitting up in bed when he came in, and she looked at him and he looked at her and neither of them spoke for a moment. She was pale. Her hair was pulled back and her face had the drawn quality of someone who has not slept enough, the skin tight across the cheekbones, the eyes clear but set in faint hollows. He sat in the chair beside the bed and took her hand and held it and her hand was warm and dry and smaller than he remembered, though it had not changed, and he held it and she let him hold it and they sat like that.

The baby was in the nursery. A nurse brought Harold to see him and he stood at the side of the small cot and looked down at his son, who was sleeping, a small red-faced creature wrapped in a white blanket, his mouth slightly open, his fingers curled in loose fists beside his face, and he looked like any baby, like Jeanie had looked, the same compressed features, the same impossible smallness, and the bandage was on his lower back, a white rectangle of gauze and tape that covered the place where the spine had not closed, and the baby slept and breathed and his chest rose and fell under the blanket and Harold stood there and looked at him.

The doctors told them what they knew, which was not much, and what they expected, which was not good. The vertebrae had failed to fuse during development, and the spinal cord was exposed, and the damage was done. There were things they could not predict, the extent of the paralysis, the likelihood of infection, how long the child would live. They used the word prognosis and the word they put before it was poor. Harold asked questions, precise questions, the questions of a scientist, mechanism and timeline and probability, and the doctors answered them and the answers were not the answers he wanted but they were the answers there were.

He stayed for a week. He held the baby, whose name was Scott, Scotty, a name Ruth had chosen from a list they had discussed in letters, and the baby was light in his arms, lighter than seemed possible for a living thing, and he held him with both hands, the head in the crook of his elbow, and the baby opened his eyes sometimes and looked at him or past him at the ceiling, and Harold looked back and what he felt was in his chest and in his throat and behind his eyes and it did not have a name.

They made arrangements. This was the word Ruth used. It meant the burial, the plot at the cemetery, the things that would need to be in place when the time came, and they did this together at the kitchen table while Jeanie played on the floor with wooden blocks, and the conversation was quiet and practical and they had it the way they had all their conversations, carefully, with the things that could not be said left unsaid.

Ruth told him to go back. She said it standing in the kitchen, holding Scotty against her shoulder, the baby's face turned toward Harold, the small eyes open, and she said it simply, you should go back, the work is there, and Harold looked at her and saw that she meant it, that this was not a test or a sacrifice but a decision she had made, and he did not argue because there was nothing to argue against.

He said he could stay. He said this because it needed to be said, because not saying it would have been a failure of a kind he could not accept, and Ruth shook her head, not impatiently but definitively, the way you shake your head when a child asks a question whose answer is obvious, and she said go, and he went.

The flight back was the same in reverse. Mexico City, then the small plane to Obregon, the desert below, the brown valley, the thin lines of the canals. Rupert was at the airfield with the truck. He drove Harold back to the station and the station was the same, the table, the shelf with the seed tins, the ledger open where Harold had left it. He put his bag on the cot and went downstairs and read what Rupert had recorded in his absence, the crosses continued, the bags opened, the results noted in Rupert's angular handwriting, everything maintained, and he closed the ledger and went outside and stood by the canal in the dark and listened to the water and the insects.

In the morning he carried the stool out to the plots. The ground was the same hard-packed earth, the rows the same, the wheat a little taller than when he had left, the bags on the crossed heads a little more weathered, but the same. He set the stool down and sat on it and the stool received him and his back curved forward and his hands came up and the scissors were in his left hand and the tweezers in his right and the first head of the day was in front of him, a cross he had not started, a new head on a plant in the third row, and he trimmed the spikelets and opened the first floret and reached in for the first anther.

Vega was in his row. The other boys were in the field. The birds rose and resettled. The canal made its sound. The sun came up over the mountains and the heat began and the light hardened and the day was the same as every other day and Harold sat on the stool and crossed wheat. The telegram was in his shirt pocket, where he had put it, folded along its crease, and his son was alive in a hospital in Wilmington, and Ruth was there with him, and Jeanie was there, and Harold was here, on the stool, in the field, in the heat, doing the work that did not stop because nothing had stopped, because the wheat was heading and the crosses needed to be made and the anthers needed to be pulled and the bags needed to be fastened and the results needed to be recorded, and he did these things, one after another, head after head, the way his father had done his work, day after day, season after season, without saying what it cost, without saying anything at all, the hands moving, the back bent, the work continuing because the work was what continued, was the thing that did not break, that held its shape when everything else lost its shape, and Harold sat on the stool and pulled anthers from wheat flowers and the morning passed and the afternoon came and the light changed and the day ended and he stood up and carried the stool back to the station and set it inside the door where he always set it and went to the table and opened the ledger and recorded the day's work in his careful hand, the cross numbers, the dates, the results, each entry a line in a record that would grow for years, that would outlast whatever was happening now, whatever was breaking, whatever could not be fixed, the record keeping its own time, its own pace, indifferent to everything except what had been done and what remained to be done, and when he was finished he closed the ledger and turned down the lantern and went up to the loft and lay on the cot and looked at the ceiling and the tin roof was still warm and the mosquitoes were there and the mice were moving below and the night was the same as every other night and he lay there and breathed and did not sleep for a long time.
