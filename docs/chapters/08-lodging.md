# Chapter 8: Lodging

The field he planted that winter was divided into four blocks, each block forty rows long, twenty rows wide, and the blocks were side by side with a path between them just wide enough for a man to walk. In the first block he planted his best tall varieties, the Lerma Rojo and the Yaqui 50 and the Chapingo 53, the lines he had been working with for years, the lines the farmers in the valley were growing, the standard. In the second block he planted the dwarf crosses, the lines that had come through five years of selection from the original Norin 10 material, the red-tagged plants from the previous season, the seed multiplied and cleaned and stored in the tins on the shelf. The third and fourth blocks were duplicates, planted the same way, tall and dwarf, for replication, because the numbers meant nothing without replication and Harold had seen too many breeders draw conclusions from a single plot.

He fertilized the blocks at double rate. Sixty kilograms of nitrogen per hectare was the standard application, and Harold had Vega spread a hundred and twenty, measured out in buckets, carried by hand, distributed evenly along the rows, the white granules scattering across the dark soil. Then, two weeks later, he had Vega spread another sixty on top of it, triple rate now, more nitrogen than any farmer in the valley would use, more than the Extension people recommended, enough to push the plants to the limit of what the soil and the water and the stems could hold. He did not tell anyone outside the station what he was doing. The fertilizer was expensive, the supply limited, and if the experiment failed the expense would be noted and the failure would be noted alongside it, and Harold had enough failures in the notebooks to know the weight of them.

The plants grew. The rains came in February, three days of steady rain, the kind that falls straight down, without wind, the drops large and heavy, the sound of it on the station roof like a continuous drumroll, and the water filled the furrows and stood in the field and the soil turned dark and the surface shone. Harold stood at the window of the station and watched the rain and drank his coffee and could not see the plots from where he stood because the rain was too thick, a gray curtain between the buildings and the field, and he waited.

On the fourth morning the rain stopped. The sky cleared in the way it cleared in the Yaqui Valley, the clouds pulling apart like cotton being separated, and the sun came through and the air was still and the puddles in the paths shone and the field was there.

Harold walked out. He could see it from a hundred meters, before he reached the path between the blocks. The first block, the tall varieties, was down. The plants had lodged. The entire block, every row, the stems bent and broken and lying flat against the mud, the heads on the ground, the leaves tangled and matted and pressed against each other, and from a distance it looked as though the block had been erased, as though someone had taken an iron and pressed the wheat flat, leaving only a low mat of green and brown where the day before there had been a canopy of standing plants that reached Harold's chest. The water was still on the ground in places, standing in the low spots between the rows, and the stems lay in it, and the heads lay in it, and the grain that had been forming in the heads was in the water and the mud.

He walked closer. The damage was complete. Not a partial lodging, not a section here and there where the wind had pushed the plants over, but total, the weight of the fertilized heads and the weight of the water on the leaves and the softness of the stems, all of it together, the physics of a tall plant carrying more weight than its structure could support, and the stems had buckled at the second and third nodes, the places where the stalk was thinnest, and the bend was permanent, the vascular tissue kinked and sealed, and the plants were dying where they lay. He knelt and picked up a stem and felt it, the wet stalk, the looseness of it, the way it bent in his hand like a piece of wet rope, no stiffness left, no resistance, and he set it down and stood up.

He turned to the second block. The dwarf crosses. He had seen it from the path, had registered it in the first moment of looking, but the tall block had drawn him first, the damage had drawn him, and now he looked at the dwarf block and what he saw was different from the tall block in a way that was not subtle, that required no measurement, no judgment, no expertise. The dwarf plants were standing. Every one of them. Every row. The stems were short and thick, the plants waist-high, the heads held upright, the grain heavy in the heads and the heads heavy on the stems and the stems straight, vertical, the way a post is vertical, the way a thing that is strong enough for what it carries is vertical, and the rain that had destroyed the tall block had done nothing to the short one except wash the dust from the leaves.

Harold stood between the two blocks. To his left the tall plants lay on the ground in a wet tangle. To his right the short plants stood in their rows, green and thick and upright, the heads catching the morning sun, and the contrast was absolute, was not a matter of degree, was not a question of some plants standing and some plants falling but of all of them, every tall plant down and every short plant up, and the only difference between the two blocks was the height and the thickness of the stem and the ratio of the one to the other.

He walked into the dwarf block. The plants came to his waist, and the canopy was different from anything he had worked in, lower and denser, the heads closer together, and the light reached the base of the plants in a way it did not reach the base of the tall varieties, the sun falling between the heads and illuminating the lower leaves and the soil, and the plants looked different in this light, compact and solid, the stems the diameter of a pencil, pale green at the base and darker above, and the heads were large relative to the height, disproportionately large, the plant having put its energy into the head and not the stalk.

He brought the stool out after breakfast. He set it at the beginning of the first row and sat down and took out the ruler, the small steel ruler with the millimeter markings that he used for this work, and he began to measure. He measured the stem diameter at the base of the first plant, placing the ruler across the stem and reading it, and the diameter was four and a half millimeters. He measured the height, from the soil line to the tip of the head, and wrote the number. He measured the angle of the head relative to the stem, the way the head hung or did not hang, the degree of arc between the vertical of the stem and the axis of the head, and in these plants the heads were nearly vertical, one or two degrees off, the stem strong enough to hold them straight, and he wrote this down. He measured the internode lengths, the distance between each joint on the stem, and they were short, compressed, each one a third or a quarter of the length of the corresponding internodes on the tall varieties, and the shortness was here, in the internodes, the plant telescoped, the same number of nodes but the spaces between them reduced, and this reduction was the dwarfing, this was what the genes did, they compressed the stem without removing the joints, without changing the basic architecture, only the scale.

He moved to the next plant. Measured it. Wrote the numbers. Moved to the next. The work was slow and the morning was warm and the sun climbed and Harold moved down the row on the stool, measuring each plant, recording each plant, and the numbers accumulated in the notebook, columns of figures, height and diameter and head angle and internode length and number of tillers and head length, and the figures were consistent, plant to plant, row to row, the variation small, the lines breeding true, the uniformity that a breeder looks for and that means the genes have stabilized, the recombination sorted out, the offspring like their parents, and these plants were like their parents, short and thick and standing.

Vega came at midday. He had been working in the nursery rows on the east side of the station, the new crosses Harold had started that fall, and he came down the path with the canvas bag over his shoulder and the scissors in his hand and he stopped at the edge of the tall block and looked at it. The lodged field. He stood there for a moment, the way a man stands when he is looking at something he has seen before but not at this scale, and then he walked past it to the dwarf block where Harold was on the stool.

He did not say anything at first. He walked into the rows and looked at the plants, bending down to look at the stems, touching a head, rubbing a spikelet between his fingers, the motion habitual, the fingers checking the grain the way they checked grain on every plant they touched, and he walked several rows deep and came back and stood near Harold.

They hold the weight, Vega said.

Harold looked up from the notebook. Vega was standing with his arms at his sides, the scissors still in one hand, and he was looking at the dwarf plants with an expression Harold had seen on him before, the expression he wore when he noticed something in the field that interested him, a narrowing of the eyes and a slight forward tilt of the head, as though he were leaning into what he was seeing.

Harold nodded.

The tall ones can't carry it, Vega said. Too much head for the stem. He said it simply, in the Spanish they spoke together, the working Spanish that had no formality in it, the language of the field. He gestured at the lodged block behind him without turning. These ones, the short ones, the stem is thick enough.

Harold looked at Vega. The man was twenty-eight years old. He had been working in the program since he was fifteen, since the first year Harold had come to the Yaqui Valley, a boy hired to chase birds from the experimental plots, and now he was standing in the field describing the relationship between stem diameter and head weight and lodging resistance in the same terms Harold would have used, not because Harold had taught him the terms but because Vega had spent thirteen years looking at wheat plants and the understanding had come through the looking, through the hands, through the ten thousand plants he had handled and measured and crossed and discarded, and it was there now, in his observation, which was accurate and which was complete.

Yes, Harold said.

They stood there, the two of them, in the dwarf rows, the short plants around them at waist height, the lodged tall plants visible beyond the path, and neither of them said anything else about it because there was nothing else to say, not yet, the observation made and noted and the work continuing, and Vega set down the canvas bag and pulled the stool from the next row and sat down and began measuring where Harold had left off, the ruler in his hand, the notebook balanced on his knee, and they worked in parallel down adjacent rows, the two stools scraping in the dirt, the pages turning, the morning gone and the afternoon beginning.

The yield data came after the harvest. Harold threshed the plots by hand, the heads cut and collected in bags labeled by row and block, the bags brought to the station and threshed on the table, the grain weighed on the balance, the weights recorded in the ledger. The tall block yielded what it could, which was not much, the lodging having killed most of the plants before the grain could fill, the kernels thin and shriveled, the weight per plot a fraction of what it would have been if the plants had stayed standing. The dwarf block yielded what its plants had promised, the grain heavy and hard and well-filled, the kernels plump, the color good, and when Harold weighed the harvested grain from the first dwarf row and divided by the area of the row and calculated the yield per hectare, the number was higher than any number he had written in the ledger before.

He checked the calculation. He recalculated it. The number did not change. He went to the next row and the next, and each row gave a number, and the numbers varied but they all fell in the same range, and the range was twenty percent above the best yield his tall varieties had ever produced under normal fertilization, not under the triple rate that had knocked them down but under the standard rate, the sixty kilograms, the amount the farmers actually used, and under the triple rate the dwarf lines yielded thirty percent more, and in some rows, the rows where the best selections had been planted, the rows with the red-tagged lines from the previous year, forty percent more.

Harold copied the numbers into the ledger in the evening. The lantern was on and the insects were at the screen and the station was quiet, the other workers gone to the village, and Harold sat at the table and wrote the numbers in columns, the row number and the variety and the plot weight and the calculated yield, and the pen moved across the paper and the numbers were there, in the book, in his handwriting, and they said what they said. He did not annotate them. He did not write a comment in the margin. He wrote the numbers and closed the ledger and put the pen down and stood up and stretched and the stretching was the stretching of a man who has been sitting for a long time, the back stiff, the shoulders tight, the hands curled from holding a pen, and he went outside and stood in the dark and the air was warm and the stars were out and the field was a dark shape beyond the buildings and he stood there.

He brought the ledger to Mexico City on his next trip. Ruth met him at the bus station, Bill on her hip, the boy heavier every time Harold saw him, his face rounder, his hair longer, and Ruth's face had the expression it wore when Harold came home, which was the expression of someone who is glad and who is also measuring something, the distance that has to be closed between the person who left and the person who stayed, and she kissed him and handed him Bill and they walked to the car.

The apartment was the same apartment but different. A drawing Jeanie had made was taped to the wall in the kitchen, a picture of an animal that might have been a horse or a dog, the legs long, the body narrow, the colors bright. Ruth had moved a bookcase from the bedroom to the front room and it held new books, a Spanish dictionary and two novels and a stack of magazines and a framed photograph of Harold's parents that he did not remember seeing before. Bill had a new pair of shoes by the door, small brown shoes, and Harold looked at them and registered their size, which was larger than the size he remembered.

He showed the ledger to no one in the apartment. He did not talk about the numbers at dinner, where Ruth had made chicken with mole, the dark sauce she had learned to make from a neighbor, the chocolate and chilies and the sesame seeds, and the taste of it was the taste of the apartment, of home, of the place Ruth had made while he was in the field, and Jeanie talked about school and a play she was going to be in and a boy named Roberto who had said something she found funny, and Bill ate with his hands and dropped rice on the floor and Ruth picked it up without pausing in the conversation and the evening was the evening of a family eating together, the four of them, the sounds and the smells and the talk, and Harold was in it and the ledger was in his bag by the door.

In the morning, early, before the family was up, Harold sat at the kitchen table and opened the ledger and looked at the numbers again. The light was gray, the same gray light that came through the curtains, and the numbers were the same numbers, unchanged by the night, unchanged by the bus ride, unchanged by the mole and the children and the sleep, and he read them slowly, running his finger down the column, and the numbers were what they were.

Harrar's office was in the Rockefeller Foundation building on Calle Londres. Harold had telephoned ahead and Harrar's secretary had given him a time, ten o'clock, and Harold arrived at ten and sat in the chair across from Harrar's desk and set the ledger on the desk between them. Harrar was older now, his hair thinner, his face lined, and he wore a tie and a jacket even in Mexico City, the formality of a man who had been promoted and who carried the promotion in his clothes. They had known each other for thirteen years and the knowing was complicated, layered with old disagreements and old compromises, the shuttle breeding fight that Harold had won and that Harrar had never entirely conceded, and the knowing sat in the room with them, in the way they spoke to each other, politely, carefully, the politeness a structure built over something rougher.

Harold opened the ledger to the page. He turned it so Harrar could read it and he pointed to the column and said what the column was, the yield per hectare for the dwarf lines and the yield per hectare for the tall lines, the same field, the same fertilization, the same water, the same season, and Harrar looked at the numbers and his face did not change, or changed in the way that a man's face changes when he is reading something he wants to understand before he responds to it, and he read the column and then the next column and then he looked at the bottom of the page where Harold had written the means, the averages, the percentages.

He said, these are from how many replications.

Harold said, four.

Harrar nodded. He looked at the numbers again. He was quiet for a moment, and the quiet was the quiet of a man thinking, and then he said, these are promising. The word was careful, was chosen, was the word of a man who had been in charge of a program for a long time and who had learned that promising results were not final results and that the distance between the two was measured in years.

We need more testing, Harrar said. Multiple sites. Multiple seasons. The standard protocol.

Harold said nothing. He did not argue. He did not lean forward or raise his voice or make the case for urgency, and the not-arguing was different from the arguing he had done in this office years ago, the shuttle breeding argument, the argument about expanding to new sites, the arguments that had nearly ended his time in the program. The not-arguing was not patience, not resignation, not strategy. It was the simple absence of the need to argue, because the numbers were on the desk, in the ledger, in Harrar's reading, and the numbers would say what they said regardless of what Harold said or did not say in this chair in this office.

Harold picked up the ledger and stood and thanked Harrar and left.

He took the bus back to the Yaqui Valley. The ride was long, the road rough in places, the bus stopping in small towns where people got on and off carrying bags and bundles and children, and Harold sat by the window and looked at the landscape passing, the dry hills and the mesquite and the long straight stretches of road that cut through the desert, and the bus rocked and the engine labored on the grades and Harold held the ledger on his lap and did not open it.

He was back in the field within a day. The next planting was already in the ground, the new generation, the seed from the best dwarf lines multiplied and sown in larger plots now, more rows, more replication, the protocol Harrar had asked for, and Harold walked the rows in the morning before the heat and the plants were young, just emerging, the green shoots pushing through the crust, and he walked among them and looked at them and they were what they were, small green things in the soil, indistinguishable from each other and from every other wheat planting he had ever walked through, and the work was ahead.

He sat on the stool in the late afternoon, when the light was long and the heat had broken and the shadows of the mountains to the east were beginning to stretch across the valley floor. The dwarf plants from the previous season's survivors were in the rows around him, the ones he had kept for seed increase, and they were at his waist, the heads heavy, the stems thick, and the tall varieties in the adjacent plots were at his chest and beyond, reaching for the sky the way tall wheat reaches, the stems thin and pale and the heads swaying in the small breeze that came off the irrigation canal in the evenings. The difference between the two was visible in the way they occupied the space, the tall plants filling it vertically, all stem, reaching, and the short plants filling it horizontally, the tillers spreading, the canopy dense and low, and the light fell differently on the two, fell through the tall plants in thin shafts that did not reach the ground, the lower leaves shaded, yellowing, dying for lack of light, while in the dwarf rows the light reached the base of every plant, fell on the lower leaves and on the soil, and the lower leaves were green, were photosynthesizing, were feeding the plant from top to bottom, and this was a thing Harold could see, the light at the bottom of the canopy, a simple physical fact, more light at the base because the plants were shorter and the heads were lower and the geometry of the whole arrangement was different, and this difference, this change in how the light fell, was the thing.

Harold did not think about what the thing meant. He did not project forward to larger fields or higher yields or the farms of the Yaqui Valley or the farms beyond the Yaqui Valley or the fields in countries he had never visited where the wheat was tall and the stems were thin and the farmers fertilized and the plants fell over. He did not think about any of this. He had a head in his hand, a head from one of the dwarf lines, and the head was heavy, the spikelets packed tight, the grain hard under the glumes, and he took the scissors and trimmed the spikelets at the tip and the base and took the tweezers and began to emasculate, pulling the anthers one by one, the small green sacs coming out clean between the points of the tweezers, and the work was precise and the work was slow and his hands were steady and the head was in front of him and the light was good and the stool was solid under him and the field was quiet except for the water in the canal and a bird somewhere in the mesquite beyond the station, and Harold worked, and the sun went down, and the air cooled, and the last of the light lay across the short plants like a hand laid flat, and he finished the head and bagged it and labeled the bag and moved the stool forward and took the next head in his hand and began again.
