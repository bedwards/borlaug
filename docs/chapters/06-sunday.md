# Chapter 6: Sunday

He woke to the sound of water running in the kitchen, the tap that had a stutter in it, a pause between the turn of the handle and the flow, and then the flow itself, thin and uneven, striking the bottom of the pot with a sound like rain on a tin roof. He lay there with his eyes open, looking at the ceiling, white plaster with a crack that ran from the light fixture to the corner, a crack he had noticed the first week and that had not changed since, and the light coming through the curtain was gray and soft, the light of early morning in Mexico City, not the hard flat white of the Yaqui Valley but a diffused light, filtered through the altitude and the haze and the buildings across the courtyard, and it fell on Ruth's side of the bed, which was empty, the pillow still dented, the blanket folded back in a neat triangle. The sounds of the apartment were around him. The water. Ruth's feet on the tile. A cabinet opening and closing. From the other bedroom the children, not yet up but stirring, a murmur from Jeanie that might have been speech or the tail end of a dream, and from Bill nothing, the silence of deep sleep, the silence of a child who slept the way only small children sleep, totally, without reservation, the body given over to it.

He got up and put on his trousers and the blue cotton shirt and walked to the kitchen in bare feet. Ruth was at the stove. She had the coffee on, the small blue enamel pot with the chipped rim, and the water was just beginning to heat, and she stood with her back to him, her hair down, which she wore down in the mornings before she pinned it up, and she was reading a letter on the counter beside the stove, and she did not turn when he came in but said good morning in the way she said it, evenly, without looking, the greeting of someone who has heard you coming and has already accounted for your presence.

Morning, he said.

The kitchen was small enough that two people in it had to coordinate their movements, and Harold stood in the doorway and then moved to the window and looked out at the courtyard three floors below, the square of concrete with the jacaranda tree in the center, its branches bare now, or nearly bare, and a thin orange cat crossing the concrete and disappearing under the stairs.

The coffee came to its rumble and Ruth poured it through the cloth strainer into the cups and handed one to Harold without looking at him, her eyes on the letter, and he took it and the cup was hot in his hands and the coffee was strong and dark, stronger than he would have made it himself, and he drank and the heat of it moved through him.

What are you reading, he said.

A letter from Margaret. She's moving to Baltimore. David got a position at Hopkins.

Harold nodded. The information settled into the category of things he was told about Ruth's world, the world of her friendships and correspondences that existed parallel to his own and that he entered only at its edges, through these small reports.

From the bedroom came Bill's voice, not crying but announcing himself, the single syllable that meant he was awake, and then the thump of his body hitting the floor, because Bill did not climb out of bed so much as launch himself from it, and then his feet on the tile, the quick uneven steps of a child who was still more comfortable running than walking, and he appeared in the doorway in his undershirt, his hair pushed up on one side, his face creased from the pillow, and he looked at Harold and then at Ruth and then at Harold again and raised his arms.

Harold picked him up. Bill was heavier than he expected, heavier than the last time, which had been weeks ago, before Toluca, and the weight of him was solid and warm against Harold's chest, and Bill put his hand on Harold's face, the flat of his palm against Harold's cheek, a gesture that was not affection exactly but investigation, the hand checking to see what was there, and Harold held him and drank his coffee with his free hand and the boy sat on his hip and looked around the kitchen with the wide slow attention of someone taking inventory.

Jeanie came in after, dressed already, a cotton dress and sandals, her hair combed, a school book under her arm, and she sat at the table and opened it without saying good morning, her presence its own greeting, the self-contained presence of a child who had learned to occupy herself. Her face had changed since the last time he had looked at it carefully, had lost some of the softness of early childhood and taken on a definition that he could see would become her adult face, Ruth's cheekbones and something around the eyes that was his own, though he would not have recognized it.

Ruth made breakfast. Eggs and tortillas and sliced papaya bright orange on the white plate, and she moved through the kitchen with the efficiency of someone who has performed these motions hundreds of times, cracking the eggs with one hand, turning the tortillas with the other, the fat popping, the smells filling the small room. She set the plates on the table and they sat and ate, and Harold asked Jeanie about the book and she told him about a chapter on monarch butterflies, the distances they covered, and she spoke quickly, mixing English and Spanish in the way that had become natural to her, a word here and there she did not bother to translate because it was the word she thought in, and Harold listened and the girl talked and the boy ate papaya and Ruth drank her coffee and the morning was there, in the kitchen, in the light, in the food and the voices.

Ruth said, the school wants parents at the assembly on Friday. She said it to Harold but she was looking at her plate, and the statement was not a question, or was a question shaped as a statement, and Harold heard both the words and what was behind them. Friday he was supposed to meet with the seed storage people at Chapingo, and the calculation was a physical thing in his body, a tightening, because one of them would have to give and he knew which one Ruth expected to give and he knew which one he would choose and the two were not the same.

I'll see if I can move the Chapingo meeting, he said.

Ruth nodded. She did not say anything else about it and her face did not change, and the subject was set aside, which was not the same as closed but which served the same function in the moment.

They walked to the market after breakfast. The street was Sunday-quiet, lined with buildings of faded pink and yellow and a green that had gone gray, laundry on the balconies and potted plants and the occasional birdcage, and the air was cool at this altitude, cooler than Harold expected each time he stepped outside, his body still calibrated to the Yaqui Valley, the thin clean air at twenty-two hundred meters lighter in his lungs, as though there were not quite enough of it. Ruth had put on a light wool coat and walked with her hands in the pockets and her stride was shorter than his and he adjusted to it without thinking, the way he had been adjusting to it for years.

The market was four blocks south, in a covered hall, and from a block away he could smell it, the sharp green of cilantro and dried chilies and the warm heavy smell of raw meat. Inside, the stalls ran in long rows under a corrugated roof, light falling through gaps in slanted columns that caught the dust and smoke from the comals where women were making tortillas, the corn dough flattened between their palms and laid on the hot iron, and the air was thick with it, corn and smoke and meat and fruit and the particular smell of a market, which was all of these and none of them.

Ruth moved through the stalls with purpose. She stopped at a vegetable stand and examined tomatoes, picking each one up, pressing it with her thumb, setting it down or putting it in the bag, and the vendor spoke to Ruth in Spanish and Ruth answered, her Spanish slower than Harold's but more correct, more grammatical, learned from books rather than from fields. They bought onions and garlic and cilantro and beans and a piece of beef the butcher wrapped in brown paper and tied with string, and limes and avocados, and Harold carried the bags, one in each hand, and the weight of them was good, was something, the weight of food he was carrying for his family, a thing to do with his hands.

Back at the apartment he unpacked the bags and opened the paper around the beef and pressed it with his finger and it was firm and cold and good. He would cook today. This was a thing he did when he was home, when there was a Sunday to fill, and the cooking was something he had always done, not because Ruth could not cook but because cooking was work, a task that required the hands and the attention and the planning, the sequence of steps that began with raw materials and ended with food on a plate, and this was satisfying in the way that crossing wheat was satisfying, the preparation and the execution and the result.

He began. He put the beans to soak and set the beef out and chopped the onions, slicing them in half first, laying each half flat, cutting thin crescents, the knife in a rhythm that was steady and practiced, the smell rising sharp and clean from the board. Bill appeared in the doorway and watched, his head tilted, and Harold was aware of him the way he was aware of Vega in the field, a presence at the edge of his vision that altered the quality of the work without changing the work itself. Come here, Harold said, and Bill came, and Harold set him on the counter beside the cutting board. He cut the garlic, smashing each clove with the flat of the blade and mincing it, and Bill reached for a piece and Harold let him take it and the boy put it in his mouth and his face changed, the shock of the raw garlic, and he took it out and looked at it and put it back in and his face changed again and he took it out for good, and Harold said nothing but his mouth moved in the way it moved when he was not quite smiling.

He browned the beef, the oil hot, the meat sizzling, the smoke rising, and he turned each piece with a fork, the color going from red to dark brown, and the smell changed as it cooked, the raw iron giving way to something deeper and richer, and he worked the pan the way he worked any tool, with attention, the heat and the oil and the protein changing state. Jeanie came in and asked to help and he gave her the tomatoes to chop, and she stood at the counter and cut them carefully, the juice running onto the board, and he watched her from the corner of his eye the way he watched the boys in the field, checking the technique, and he almost corrected the way she held the knife but did not, because her way was producing chopped tomatoes and that was what was needed.

The apartment filled with the smell. The tomatoes went into the pan and the beef went back in and the dried chilies, split and seeded, and the water, and the lid, and the heat turned low, and the thing that happened next was waiting, the slow transformation that could not be hurried, and Harold stood at the stove and listened to the simmer and adjusted the flame and stood there. And then the stew was on and the beans were soaking and the morning had become afternoon and Harold was in the kitchen with nothing to do.

He went to the front room. The sofa, the bookshelf Ruth had filled with novels and histories and a Spanish grammar, Harold's notebooks and correspondence on the lower shelf, the rug she had bought, dark red with a pattern of flowers. He sat on the sofa and it received him with its familiar sag and he sat there and his hands were on his knees and he looked at the room.

He picked up a book, Ruth's novel, opened it to the middle, read a paragraph, and the words moved past him without catching. He set it down. He picked up the newspaper, two days old, read the headlines and part of an article, and put the paper down.

His hands were on his knees again. He could feel them there, the broad square hands that spent their days holding tweezers and scissors and wheat heads, hands that had a purpose in the field and that here, in this room, on this sofa, on this Sunday, had no purpose, were just hands, resting, and the resting was a thing he did not know how to do, not in the way that a man who has never rested does not know how to rest but in the way that a tool that has been used for one thing does not know how to be used for another, the shape of it wrong, the balance off, and Harold sat there and the afternoon was long.

He got up and took down the folder of correspondence. Letters from Stakman, three of them, and the most recent was about the new varieties, the Lerma Rojo and the Yaqui 50, the results from test plots in Minnesota and Canada, and the language was the language Harold lived in, yield and resistance and maturity and photoperiod, and he read it standing by the shelf and the words were solid in his mind, they had weight, they referred to things he could see and touch and measure, and then the third letter, about a new strain of rust in Manitoba, race 15B, and underneath Stakman's careful language Harold could hear the concern, because a new race meant the work would have to respond, the years of crossing and selecting could be set back, and Harold stood there with the letter in his hand and thought about the plots in Toluca, the crosses he had planted three weeks ago, the seed in the ground, and whether any of them would hold against 15B, and this thinking was different from the thinking he had been doing on the sofa, this was the kind his mind was made for, the kind that moved forward in steps, problem to response to plan, and he could feel his body change, a settling, a coming into alignment, the way a tool settles into the hand it was made for.

Ruth came into the room. She had pinned her hair up and she carried a book and she sat in the chair by the window and began to read. She did not ask what he was reading. She did not comment on the fact that he was standing by the shelf with Stakman's letter on a Sunday afternoon. She simply sat and read, and her silence was not indifference, it was something else, a kind of space she made for him, the knowledge of a person who has watched another person long enough to understand the shape of them, the things they reach for and the things they cannot reach for, and the making of that space was either love or patience or the thing that exists where love and patience overlap, which has no name.

Harold put the letter back and went to check the stew. He lifted the lid and the steam rose and the smell was rich and deep, the beef and onions and chilies merged now into something more than any of them alone, and he stirred and tasted and added salt and tasted again and it was closer. He cooked the beans separately in fresh water with a bay leaf.

Bill was asleep on the floor of the bedroom, curled on the rug beside the bed, his body in the abandoned posture of a sleeping child, the limbs flung out, the face slack, and Harold bent down and picked him up and carried him to the sofa and sat down with him. Bill did not wake. His breathing was slow and his body was warm and loose and his weight settled against Harold's chest, and Harold sat there with his son asleep on him and Ruth reading in her chair and Jeanie somewhere in the bedroom, a page turning, and the light from the window was changing now, going from gray to gold as the afternoon sun broke through, and it fell across the rug and across the boy's face and the boy did not stir.

Harold sat still. The boy's weight held him there and his hands held the boy and this was something his hands could do, the holding of a sleeping child, and Harold did this with the same attention he brought to everything, the awareness of the weight and the breathing, the small adjustments as the boy shifted. And he thought about the Toluca planting, the twelve hundred crosses in rows along the slope, and the germination starting now, the first shoots pushing through the dark soil, the cycle that never stopped, and he sat on the sofa with his son asleep on his chest and thought about wheat in a field two hundred kilometers away and the thinking was steady and calm and it moved through him the way the stew simmered on the stove, continuously, a low heat that did not need tending.

Ruth turned a page. The sound of it was small and precise in the quiet room.

They ate at the table in the evening, the four of them. Harold served the stew, the beef tender now, falling apart, the broth dark and rich, and the beans and tortillas he had warmed and lime wedges and chopped cilantro. Bill ate with his hands, tearing tortilla and dipping it, his face and fingers shining, and Jeanie ate carefully, and Ruth said the stew was good and it was good, the hours had done what hours of simmering do, broken the thing down and built it back up, and they ate together and the kitchen was warm and the window was fogged and the sounds of the meal were the sounds of any meal, spoons and tearing bread and the small noises of four people eating. Jeanie told them about a friend named Lucia who had a dog that had puppies, and could she go see them, and Ruth said yes, and the conversation moved around the table, light and practical, the conversation of a family at dinner in a small apartment in a city that had become, in the way that any place becomes home if you stay in it long enough and eat enough meals in it, theirs.

Harold washed the dishes. The pots and bowls and spoons, the water warm, the soap, and the kitchen was clean when he was done, the counters wiped, the stove wiped, and this was satisfying, the end of a sequence, the meal cooked and eaten and cleaned up, and the satisfaction was real but it was also the satisfaction of something finished, something that no longer required his hands, and the evening stretched ahead with nothing in it.

Ruth put Bill to bed. Harold could hear her reading to him, a book in English she read every night, the words so familiar that Bill sometimes said the next word before she did, and then the reading stopped and the bedroom went quiet.

Jeanie was at the table with her school book. Harold sat across from her and watched her read, her head bent, her hair falling forward, and he wanted to ask her something, about school, about her friends, about the life she lived in the hours when he was not there, which were most of the hours, but the questions he could think of were the questions he had already asked, and the answers would be the answers she had already given, and so he sat and Jeanie read and the lamp made its circle of light on the table and the girl was inside it.

She looked up. She looked at him with an attention that was careful, that was measuring something, and he did not know what she was measuring but he could feel it, the quality of her looking, and then she said, Papa, will you be here next Sunday too.

He said he would try.

She nodded and went back to her book.

Ruth came out and made tea and brought two cups and took hers to the chair by the window and sat down with her book. Jeanie said goodnight and closed her door, and then it was the two of them, Harold and Ruth, the lamp on the table and the light by Ruth's chair, two circles of light in the room, and between them the rug and the sofa and the quiet.

Harold looked at his hands. They were on his knees, where they had been all afternoon when they were not holding a knife or a spoon or a child, and he turned them over and looked at the palms, the calluses and the lines and the thickness of the fingers, and then he turned them back.

Ruth read. The pages turned at intervals, and the light from her lamp fell on the page and on her hands and on the collar of her dress, and her face was in profile, and she was beautiful in the way that people who are concentrating are beautiful, the face given over entirely to the thing it is doing, emptied of performance, and Harold did not think this, did not form the word in his mind, but he looked at her, and the looking was its own kind of knowledge.

He went to the kitchen and stood in the dark and looked out at the courtyard, the jacaranda tree a black shape against the sky, and the kitchen smelled of what he had cooked, the stew and the beans and the garlic, the smell of the day's work, and he stood in it.

He went back to the front room. Ruth was still reading. He sat and the evening continued and the two circles of light held their positions in the room and the darkness between them was not empty, was full of the things the day had held, the breakfast and the market and the cooking and the children and the letter from Stakman and the sleeping boy on his chest and Jeanie's question, all of it, the whole Sunday, a day in which nothing had happened, in which a family had done what families do, and it was over now, or nearly over, and Harold sat in his circle of light and Ruth sat in hers and they did not speak, because there was nothing to say that had not been said or that could not wait until tomorrow, and the quiet held them the way the apartment held them, closely, without effort, and they lived in it, and the night came on, and the day was done.
