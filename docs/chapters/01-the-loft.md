# Chapter 1: The Loft

The road south from Ciudad Obregon was unpaved, and the dust came through the windows of the truck in a fine pale curtain that settled on everything, on the dashboard, on the seats, on the sleeves of Harold's shirt, on the side of his neck where the sweat gathered and turned it to a thin paste. He wiped his forearm across his face and looked out at the valley. It was flat. Flat in a way that should have been familiar to him, having grown up on the plains of northeast Iowa, but this was a different kind of flat, a flat that did not promise anything, that was not waiting for seed or cultivation but simply was, extending in every direction under a sky so white with heat it barely qualified as blue. Mesquite scrub and cactus. The dust. A canal running alongside the road, the water in it brown and slow, carrying snowmelt from the mountains through concrete channels that were cracked and stained with mineral deposits. Everything looked like it had been left out in the sun for fifty years.

Rupert was driving. He had one hand on the wheel and the other arm resting on the door, his elbow jutting out into the hot air, and he had not spoken in twenty minutes, which Harold had come to understand was not silence born of displeasure or fatigue but simply the way the man was. They had met in Mexico City three days earlier, at the offices on Londres Street, and in those three days Harold had learned that Rupert spoke when he had something to say and did not speak when he did not, and that the threshold between those two states was higher than in most people. He was from Montana. He had been in the Pacific, though he did not say where, and had come back and finished his degree at Bozeman and now here he was, driving a borrowed truck through the Sonoran desert toward a research station neither of them had seen. He was thin, not in an unhealthy way, but in the way of someone who had been pared down to what was necessary, and he moved with a deliberateness that made everything he did seem considered, even when it was not.

They passed a cluster of houses, low concrete structures with corrugated tin roofs, and children standing in a doorway watching the truck go by, and then the houses were behind them and there was the valley again, the scrub, the irrigation canals branching off from the main channel like veins, carrying water out into the fields where some of it was being used and some of it was just soaking into the cracked earth. The dam at Oviachic fed all of it, Harold knew, the whole system of canals and ditches that made farming possible in a place where the summer temperatures routinely exceeded a hundred degrees, where the rain when it came fell in violent bursts and then stopped, and the land went back to being what it was, which was desert. He had read about the valley in the materials the Foundation had sent him, had studied the maps and the rainfall charts and the soil analyses, but none of that had prepared him for the look of it, the way the heat sat on everything like a physical weight, the way the light was so bright it seemed to eliminate shadow, to flatten the world into a single plane of white and brown and pale green.

The station was on the south side of the road, set back behind a low wall of adobe that had partially collapsed on the eastern end. Harold saw it first as a shape in the heat shimmer, a rectangular building with a flat roof and a smaller structure beside it, and as they got closer the details filled in and the details were not encouraging. The main building was concrete block, painted white at some point in the past but now a mottled gray where the paint had peeled away in long strips. There were windows along the front, four of them, and two had cracked panes and one was missing its glass entirely, a square of darkness in the pale wall. The door was wooden, warped in its frame so that it did not close properly, and above the door someone had nailed a piece of tin to serve as an awning, though it had bent downward on one side and hung at an angle. The smaller building was a storage shed, or had been, its roof partly caved in, and beside it sat a tractor, or what had once been a tractor, its tires flat, its engine hood propped open with a stick, the engine inside coated in a thick layer of dust and oil and something that might have been bird droppings.

Rupert pulled the truck alongside the building and turned off the engine and they sat there for a moment in the ticking quiet, the heat pressing in through the windows now that the air was not moving, and then Rupert said, well, and Harold said, yes, and they got out.

The heat was astonishing. He had known it would be hot, had been told it would be hot, but knowing and feeling were different operations entirely. It was like stepping into an oven that had no walls. The air itself seemed thick with it, and his body responded immediately, the sweat springing out on his forehead, on his chest, down the backs of his legs. He stood by the truck and looked at the building and the shed and the collapsed wall and the dead tractor and he thought about the lab in Wilmington, the clean surfaces, the air conditioning, the hum of equipment that worked, and then he stopped thinking about that and walked toward the door.

Inside it was darker and marginally cooler, though cooler was a relative term that did not mean cool. The main room was perhaps thirty feet by twenty, with a concrete floor that was covered in dust and mouse droppings and, along the far wall, a pile of grain sacks that had been stacked at some point and had since slumped sideways so that several had split open, spilling wheat onto the floor. The wheat was infested. He could see the weevils moving in it even from across the room, the tiny dark shapes working through the grain, and the smell of it was thick and sour, the smell of rot, of stored grain gone bad. There was a table in the center of the room, a heavy wooden table with one leg shorter than the others so that it rocked when he touched it, and on the table were scattered papers, a coffee can full of pencils, a kerosene lantern with a cracked chimney, and a pair of work gloves so stiff with dried sweat and dirt that they held the shape of hands. Along one wall was a shelf unit made of raw pine boards, and on the shelves were jars and cans and boxes of various sizes, some labeled in Spanish, some not labeled at all, and a set of scales with a film of dust on the pans, and a microscope in a wooden case. He opened the case. The microscope was German, a decent one, and appeared to be undamaged. He closed the case and set it back on the shelf.

A wooden staircase at the back of the room led up to the loft. The stairs were narrow and steep, more like a ladder than a staircase, and they creaked badly under his weight. The loft was the full length of the building, a long low space under the roof joists with a plank floor and a window at each end, neither of which had glass. The light came through these windows in two dusty shafts and fell on the floor and on the piles of burlap sacking and the old wooden crates that had been pushed against the walls. There were two cots, metal-framed, with stained mattresses that were thin enough that the springs showed through in places, and beside each cot was an overturned crate that served as a nightstand. The ceiling was low enough that Harold, standing straight, could press his palm flat against the underside of the roof. The heat up here was worse than below, trapped under the tin roof, and the air had a close, animal smell, grain and dust and something else, the warm musk of rodents, and as his eyes adjusted he could see droppings along the baseboards and in the corners, the small dark pellets of mice and the larger ones of rats.

He went back downstairs. Rupert was standing in the doorway, leaning against the frame, looking out at the yard.

We should sweep, Harold said.

Rupert nodded.

They found a broom in the shed, its bristles worn down to stubs, and a shovel, and they began. Harold swept the main room, working from the back corners forward, pushing the dust and droppings and grain chaff into a pile by the door, and then he shoveled the pile into a wheelbarrow he had found behind the shed, a wheelbarrow with a rusted wheel that squealed as it turned, and he pushed it out into the yard and dumped it. He went back and swept again. The floor was concrete and would never be clean, not really, but it could be clear. He moved the table and swept under it. He moved the shelf unit, which was heavier than it looked, and swept behind it and found a dead mouse, desiccated, flat, curled like a comma, and he swept that up too. The split grain sacks he dragged outside and piled by the wall. The weevils scattered as he moved the sacks, running in every direction across the floor, and he swept those up with everything else.

Rupert worked on the loft. Harold could hear him overhead, the thump of crates being moved, the scrape of the broom on the plank floor, and once a sharp crack that might have been a board breaking. After a while Rupert came down with an armload of burlap sacking that was so chewed through by rodents it was more hole than fabric, and he carried it outside and dropped it on the pile and went back up.

They worked through the afternoon. Harold cleaned the table, wiping it down with a rag and water from the canteen, and he organized the shelf, throwing away what was clearly ruined, which was most of it, and arranging what remained. He found a box of nails and a hammer under the shelf and he nailed the warped door more firmly into its frame so that it would close, though it still stuck at the top and had to be forced. He found a piece of sheet metal in the shed and cut it with tin snips and fitted it over the broken window, securing it with nails. The other broken pane he left for now. There was no glass to replace it with, and the sheet metal had only been large enough for one.

At some point in the late afternoon he went out to the truck and got the box of supplies they had brought from Mexico City: canned food, a bag of rice, a bag of beans, coffee, a small kerosene stove, matches, soap, two towels, a first-aid kit, and the seed packets, twenty-three packets of wheat varieties that had been selected and prepared at the Chapingo station, each packet labeled in Dr. Stakman's precise handwriting. He carried the box inside and set it on the table and unpacked it methodically, placing each item in a specific location on the shelf, the food together, the stove on the lower shelf, the seed packets on the highest shelf where they might be safe from the mice, though he doubted it. He would need to find tins to store them in. Metal containers with tight-fitting lids. That would be tomorrow's problem.

The sun was going down. It went quickly here, faster than in Iowa, the light changing from white to gold to a deep orange that turned the walls of the building the color of clay and made long shadows of the mesquite scrub out in the yard, and then it was dusk, and the heat began, not to dissipate exactly, but to soften, to become something other than the crushing force it had been all day. He stood in the doorway and looked out at the valley. The irrigation canal caught the last light and held it, a line of gold running through the brown landscape, and beyond it the fields, some planted, some bare, and beyond those the low dark line of the mountains to the east. A dog was barking somewhere, a distant rhythmic sound, and closer, in the scrub around the building, the insects were starting up, a rising hum that would grow through the night until it was a wall of sound, cicadas and crickets and things he had no name for, a noise so dense and continuous that after a while you stopped hearing it, the way you stopped hearing the sound of your own breathing.

He thought about calling Ruth. There was a telephone in Obregon, at the hotel, and he could drive in and call, but it was an hour each way on that road, and by the time he got there the rates would be highest, and what would he say. He would say he had arrived, that the station was fine, that the work would go well, and she would hear the flatness in his voice and ask what was wrong and he would say nothing, everything is fine, and she would know he was lying but would not press because that was how they were with each other, careful, polite, leaving room. He would call tomorrow. Or the day after. He would write a letter tonight.

Rupert came down from the loft and said the mattresses were bad but not impossible, and that he had found a scorpion under one of the crates and killed it with his boot. Harold nodded. Rupert filled a pot with water from the canteen and set it on the kerosene stove and lit the stove, and the blue flame caught and steadied, and he put rice in the pot and opened a can of beans with his knife and set that beside the stove to heat. They ate sitting on the floor with their backs against the wall, the plates balanced on their knees, and the food was bland but hot, and Harold was hungry enough that it tasted good, the way any food tastes good when you have earned it with your body.

After dinner he went out into the yard and washed his hands and face with water from the truck's canteen and dried them on his shirt. The stars were out now, more than he had ever seen, a dense scattering across the whole sky, and the Milky Way was visible as a pale band running from horizon to horizon. He stood there looking up and listening to the insects and the distant dog and the faint sound of water moving in the canal, and the heat was still there, not gone, just gentler now, like a hand that had loosened its grip. From somewhere to the south came the low rumble of a truck on the road, the sound carrying a long way in the flat empty air, and then it faded and there was just the insects again.

Inside, Rupert had laid out his bedroll on one of the cots and was reading a paperback by the light of the kerosene lantern, holding the book in one hand close to his face, and Harold could see the title, it was a western, a Louis L'Amour, and this struck him as either perfectly appropriate or absurd and he did not know which. He climbed the narrow stairs to the loft and sat on the edge of his cot and pulled off his boots. The mattress springs complained when he lay down. The ceiling was close above him, the underside of the tin roof, and he could feel the heat radiating from it, the stored heat of the day being released slowly into the narrow space. He had draped the mosquito netting over the cot frame, a precaution he was already grateful for, because he could hear them, the mosquitoes, the high thin whine of them circling in the dark, landing on the netting, and he could see them when he looked closely, their silhouettes against the lighter fabric, dozens of them, gathered and waiting.

He lay on his back and looked at the ceiling and listened to the sounds of the building. The creak of wood contracting as the temperature shifted. The dry scurry of something small and fast across the plank floor, a mouse or a rat, he could not tell which in the dark. The wind had come up and was pressing against the tin roof, making it flex and pop in irregular intervals, and through the open windows the smell of the desert came in, the dry mineral scent of it, and under that something green, the fields, the irrigated land, the crops that had been planted and were growing in the dark.

He thought about the wheat. Twenty-three varieties in labeled packets on the shelf downstairs, each one a set of possibilities, a collection of genetic traits that might or might not be what was needed here, in this soil, in this heat, against the particular strains of rust that had destroyed three successive harvests in this valley. He did not know yet what the soil was like, had not held it in his hand, had not smelled it or tasted it, which was something his father did, put a pinch of soil on his tongue and stand there working it around in his mouth like a man tasting wine, and Harold had never asked him what he learned from doing that, and now he could not ask because they did not talk about such things, had never talked about such things, and what passed between them was a kind of mutual work, side by side in silence, the shared labor of the farm being the only language available. Tomorrow he would walk the fields. He would look at the soil and the irrigation system and the canals and he would begin to understand what was here and what was needed and then the work would begin.

He turned on his side. The mattress springs pressed against his hip and shoulder. Something was moving in the grain pile downstairs, a deliberate rustling, heavier than a mouse, and he listened to it for a while and then stopped listening to it because there was nothing to be done about it tonight. He was tired. His body was tired in a way that felt earned, the muscles in his arms and back sore from the sweeping and lifting, and this was a good feeling, a feeling he knew, the feeling of having done enough in a day to justify lying down.

The next morning he was up before the sun. The air in the loft was warm already but not yet punishing, and he lay still for a moment, orienting himself, the unfamiliar ceiling, the smell of grain and dust, the mosquito netting around him like a cocoon, and then he remembered where he was and got up and pulled on his boots and went downstairs. Rupert's cot was already empty, the blanket folded at the foot, and Harold found him outside, standing by the canal, drinking coffee from a tin cup. The sky in the east was beginning to lighten, a pale band above the mountains, and the air was cool in that brief way that desert air is cool in the early morning, a coolness that felt like a gift and that would be gone within the hour.

Harold made his own coffee on the kerosene stove and took it outside and stood beside Rupert and they drank their coffee and watched the light come up over the valley. The canal water was dark and flat and moving slowly, and a bird was working the surface, some kind of heron, long-legged, stepping with that careful deliberation that wading birds have, lifting each foot high and placing it precisely, and Harold watched it for a while, the patience of it, the focused attention, and then the bird struck and came up with a small fish and swallowed it and went back to its stepping.

What's the plan, Rupert said.

Harold told him. Walk the fields first. Look at the soil, the irrigation infrastructure, the fencing. Assess what equipment they had and what they needed. Make a list. Find the local farmers who might help. Someone named Jones, a woman who had been mentioned in the Foundation's notes, and a man named Campoy who had a tractor and might loan it out. Plant the first test plots as soon as possible. Get seed in the ground. Everything else was secondary.

Rupert nodded and finished his coffee and rinsed the cup with water from the canteen and set it on the step to dry. He went inside to get his hat and Harold stayed where he was, standing by the canal, watching the light spread across the valley, the shadows retreating, the color of the land shifting from gray to brown to a pale gold as the sun cleared the mountains. The heat was already building. He could feel it on his face, on his forearms, a gentle pressure that would become something much less gentle as the hours passed. He drank the rest of his coffee. It was bitter and too strong and not quite hot enough and it was the best coffee he had ever had. He poured out the dregs and went inside and got his notebook and a pencil and put on his hat and stepped back out into the morning.

They walked east along the canal road, following the main channel as it ran straight through the valley, the water moving slowly beside them, brown and opaque, carrying silt from the mountains. The fields on either side were planted in patches, some with wheat that was already heading, short and thin-stemmed, and some with cotton, and some that were bare, the soil cracked and dry between the irrigation furrows. Harold stopped at the first wheat field and knelt at the edge and pulled a plant and held it up and looked at it. The head was small and the grain was shriveled and the stem, when he split it with his thumbnail, showed the telltale pustules of rust, the reddish-brown lesions that burst through the surface of the plant like blisters. He held it up so Rupert could see.

Stem rust, he said.

Rupert looked at it and said nothing, which was an adequate response.

They kept walking. Harold stopped at each field and pulled plants and examined them and wrote in his notebook, quick entries in a tight hand, the variety where he could determine it, the stage of growth, the condition of the soil, the state of the irrigation furrows, whether the field had been weeded, whether there were signs of disease. Most of the fields showed rust. Some were so badly infected that the plants were already dying, the leaves brown and curled, the heads empty or filled with shriveled grain that would be worthless. It was the same disease that had swept through the valley three times in three years, in 1939 and 1940 and 1941, destroying the harvests and driving farmers off their land, and it was still here, living in the soil, in the stubble of previous crops, waiting for each new planting.

The sun was fully up now and the heat was real, a presence, something to be negotiated with and accommodated. Harold could feel it on the top of his head through his hat and on the back of his neck and in his lungs when he breathed. His shirt was wet. He took off his hat and wiped his forehead with his sleeve and put his hat back on and kept walking. They came to a junction in the canal system where a smaller channel branched off to the south, and here the concrete was cracked badly, a section of it had collapsed, and the water was leaking out into the road, turning the dust to mud. Harold wrote this down. The whole irrigation system would need to be repaired before they could control the water distribution to the test plots, and controlling water was everything, because the variables had to be managed, soil and water and seed and nothing else, or the results would mean nothing.

By midmorning they had walked three miles and Harold had filled six pages of his notebook and they were out of water. They turned back. The walk back was hotter than the walk out, the sun higher now and the shade of the mesquites, what little there had been, reduced to small dark circles at the base of each tree. A truck passed them on the road going the other direction and the driver, a man in a straw hat, raised his hand and Harold raised his hand back, and the truck went on and the dust settled.

Back at the station Harold filled the canteens from the water tank behind the building, a concrete cistern that was fed by the canal through a pipe that had a valve on it, and the valve was stiff and required both hands to turn, and the water that came out was brown at first and then cleared, more or less, to a color that was not quite clean but was what they had. He drank a full canteen standing in the shade of the building and then filled it again and drank half of that. His body was telling him things about the heat that his mind had not yet fully processed, and he listened to his body because that was what you did, you did not override it, you responded to it, the way you responded to any piece of equipment that was sending you a signal, with attention and the appropriate adjustment.

He spent the afternoon cleaning the microscope and setting up a work area on the table in the main room. He unpacked the seed packets and examined each one, counting the seeds, checking for damage, recording the quantities in his notebook. Twenty-three varieties of wheat, each one bred for some specific combination of traits, disease resistance, yield, protein content, stem strength, maturity time, and each one untested in this particular environment, in this soil, in this heat, against this particular population of Puccinia graminis. The work of the next months would be to plant them, grow them, infect them with rust, and see which ones survived. It was simple work in concept and complex in execution and it would require more labor and more equipment than he currently had, which was himself and Rupert and a broken tractor and a borrowed truck and a broom with no bristles.

He wrote the letter to Ruth after dinner. He sat at the table with the kerosene lantern and wrote on a piece of notebook paper, pressing carefully because the table rocked with each stroke of the pencil. He told her about the drive down from Mexico City, about the mountains and then the desert and then the valley. He told her about the station, and he was honest about its condition because Ruth was not someone who needed to be protected from facts, but he framed it as a project, something to be fixed, a set of problems to be solved, because that was how he saw it, or how he needed to see it. He asked about Jeanie, whether she was sleeping through the night yet, whether the tooth that had been coming in had broken through. He asked Ruth how she was feeling, meaning the pregnancy, and he wrote that he missed her, which was true but which he wrote the way you write such things in letters, as a statement rather than a feeling, because the feeling was something else, something more complicated, not just missing but guilt and relief and a low steady current of something that might have been fear, the fear that he had made the wrong choice, or the fear that he had made the right one and that the right choice was the one that took him away. He did not write about any of that. He signed the letter and folded it and put it in an envelope and addressed it to their apartment in Wilmington, where Ruth and Jeanie would stay until he found them a place, and he set the envelope on the shelf and turned down the lantern and went up to the loft.

The night sounds were the same as the night before. The insects, the wind on the tin roof, the scurry of rodents, the mosquitoes against the netting. Rupert was already asleep, or seemed to be, his breathing slow and even from the other cot. Harold lay on his back and listened and the sounds settled into a kind of pattern, or his mind made them into a pattern, the crickets rising and the wind pushing and the roof popping and the small animals moving below, and after a while the pattern became a rhythm and the rhythm became a presence and the presence was the place itself, this place where he had come to do his work, this broken-down station in the desert where the wheat was dying and the equipment was ruined and the rats owned the loft, and he was here now, he was in it, and tomorrow there would be more to do than today, and the day after that more still, and the days would be long and hot and full of the kind of work that did not look like anything from the outside, the careful patient work of planting and measuring and recording and waiting, the work that built nothing visible, that produced no immediate result, that required you to believe in a future you could not see, and he was good at this, had always been good at this, the way some people were good at conversation or music, he was good at the sustained effort, the ongoing thing, the work that did not end when the day ended but continued in the mind, in the planning, in the slow accretion of knowledge that might, eventually, become something useful.

He closed his eyes. The heat was still there, gentler now, and through the open window at the far end of the loft he could see a single bright star, low on the horizon, and he watched it until it blurred and then he was asleep.
