# Chapter 11: Fumigation

The dead seeds were darker than the living ones. Not by much, not in a way a person would notice unless he had spent twenty years looking at wheat seed, but Harold noticed, the slight discoloration, the surface of the dead seeds dull where the living ones still held a faint sheen, and the difference was the difference between a thing that would grow and a thing that would not, a difference that had been imposed by the customs fumigant, the methyl bromide that had been applied at the port in quantities that were, according to the station superintendent, standard, though the standard had killed roughly half of what was in the sacks.

Harold stood in the seed testing room. The room was small, whitewashed, lit by a single window set high in the wall, and the germination trays were arranged on the table, the blotting paper damp, the seeds laid out in their rows, and the rows told the story plainly. Some seeds had cracked and sent out the white root tip, the first evidence of life, the radicle pushing through the seed coat, and beside them the others sat unchanged, dark, inert, seeds that would never open. Harold counted. He had been counting since Swaminathan had left him alone in the room an hour earlier, counting the living and the dead, making marks in the notebook, tray by tray, variety by variety, and the numbers were consistent across the trays, the germination rate holding at forty-five to fifty percent, which meant that of the seed that had traveled from the Yaqui Valley to the port at Guaymas and across the ocean and through the customs shed and up the rail line to this station in the Punjab, half was usable and half was not.

He closed the notebook. He set the pencil on the table and stood with his hands at his sides and looked at the trays and the trays looked back at him, the rows of living and dead arranged in their grid, and the room was warm and the light from the high window fell across the table in a bar of yellow that illuminated the center trays and left the ones at the edges in shadow. His jaw was tight. The muscles at the hinge of it were clenched and had been clenched since the first tray, and the tension was there in his neck and in his shoulders, a contraction that did not release, and he stood with it.

The men were waiting outside. Swaminathan and two agronomists from the research station and a man from the state agriculture department and two young technicians who had done the germination tests, who had laid out the seeds and dampened the blotting paper and covered the trays and waited the required hours and then uncovered them and seen what Harold had now seen. They stood in the corridor, five men and two young men, and they looked at Harold when he came out of the room and Harold said the number. Forty-seven percent average germination across the lots.

The silence that followed was the silence of men doing arithmetic. Forty-seven percent meant that a field planted at the normal seeding rate would come up thin, gaps in the rows, bare soil where there should be plants, and thin stands meant low yields, and low yields meant that the demonstration would fail, the short wheat standing sparse and unconvincing in fields where it was supposed to prove itself, and the proving was the point, the entire shipment had crossed an ocean for the proving.

Harold said what he had already calculated in the room. Double the seeding rate. Plant two seeds for every one that was needed. The living seed would compensate for the dead. The stands would be adequate. Not perfect, not the thick uniform stands he grew at the Yaqui station, but adequate, enough to demonstrate the varieties, enough to show the yields, enough to show that the short wheat stood while the tall wheat fell.

Harold said he needed a table and the planting schedule and the list of stations and the seed allocation by variety. Swaminathan led him to an office at the end of the corridor and there was a table and Harold sat down and opened the notebook and began to work.

The arithmetic took the afternoon. Harold sat at the table with the planting schedule spread before him and worked through the numbers station by station, adjusting the seeding rate, reallocating the seed, cutting some stations from the plan entirely and increasing the allocation to others, the choices made not by importance but by readiness, the stations that had already prepared their fields receiving more seed and the stations that had not yet prepared receiving none, because the seed in the ground was the only seed that mattered and the seed in the sack was potential that diminished with every day it sat unplanted.

By evening the plan was done. He had trimmed twelve stations from the original forty-three and redistributed their seed to the remaining thirty-one, and the seeding rate at each station was doubled, and the total acreage was reduced by a third, and the plan was not what anyone had wanted but it was what the living seed would support, and Harold closed the notebook and sat back and his shoulders ached and the afternoon light had gone and the office was lit by a single bulb that hung from a cord.

He did not sleep well that night. The room they had given him was in a guesthouse adjacent to the station, a room with a narrow bed and a ceiling fan that turned slowly, and the sounds outside the window were unfamiliar, the calls of birds he did not know, the barking of dogs, a radio playing music in a mode he could not follow, and he lay on the bed and the ceiling fan turned and the notebook was on the table beside the bed and the numbers in the notebook were the numbers of what had survived and what had not.

The replanting began the next week. Harold traveled. He went by jeep and by train and once by a bus so crowded that he stood in the aisle for three hours, his hand gripping the overhead rail, his bag between his feet, the press of bodies around him, men in white cotton and women in colored fabric and children who stared at him from below and he stared back, and the bus moved through the Punjab, the flat fields on both sides of the road, the canals running silver in the sun, and Harold watched the fields and the fields were planted with wheat, tall wheat, the old varieties, the stems chest-high and thin and already, in some fields, beginning to lean.

At each station the work was the same. Harold met the station agronomist and inspected the seed and checked the germination of the local lots, which varied, some better than the lots he had tested, some worse, the fumigation having been uneven, heavier on some sacks and lighter on others depending on their position in the warehouse when the gas was applied. He walked the prepared fields and assessed the soil and the irrigation and the condition of the beds, and he adjusted the seeding rate for each station based on the germination of the seed available there, the calculations made in the field, in the notebook, pencil on paper, and the agronomists listened and wrote it down and the planting proceeded.

The young men at the stations reminded Harold of the boys in the valley. Not in their appearance, not in their language or their clothing or the color of their skin, but in the way they bent to the work, the way they handled the seed, the way they stood at the edge of the field and looked at the rows with the attention of men who had not yet learned to take the work for granted. They were young agronomists, most of them, educated men, not field boys, but the posture was the same, the curved back, the hands in the soil, the looking, and Harold showed them what he showed everyone, how to assess the stand, how to count the tillers, how to read the crop the way a man reads a page, the information there for the eye that knew how to see it.

In Ludhiana he spent four days. The agronomist there was a man named Singh, one of several Singhs Harold would meet, and Singh had prepared twenty hectares and had already planted half of them at the doubled rate and the stand was coming up, thin but coming up, the green shoots emerging from the brown soil in rows that were gapped but present, and Harold walked the rows and counted and the count was low but within the range he had calculated, and he told Singh to increase the nitrogen to compensate, to push the tillers, to make each surviving plant produce more heads, and Singh wrote it down.

Harold had brought his stool from Mexico in the bag, the three-legged stool that folded flat, the seat worn smooth by twenty years. At Ludhiana he unfolded it and set it in the test plot and sat down and took the tweezers from his shirt pocket. He was not crossing, not here, but he was looking, the close looking that required the stool, the body low and the eyes near the plants and the hands free to touch and pull and examine, and the young men at the station stood at the edge of the plot and watched him, this American on a stool in their field, his hands moving among the heads with a familiarity that could not be faked, and Harold worked and did not look up and the young men watched.

The war began while Harold was in the field. He did not hear it start. He heard about it from Singh, who came to the edge of the plot where Harold was working and said that the radio was reporting fighting on the border, that the Indian and Pakistani armies were engaged, that the border was closed. Harold looked up from the stool and Singh's face was tight, drawn, and behind him the other men at the station were standing in the yard, grouped together, talking in low voices in a language Harold could not follow.

Harold asked what it meant for the seed.

Singh looked at him. The looking was the looking of a man being asked a practical question in the middle of something that was not practical, something that involved his country and his people and the threat of war, and Harold's question was about seed.

The seed for Pakistan, Harold said. The allocations for the Pakistani stations.

Singh shook his head. Nothing was crossing the border. The roads were closed, the trains stopped. Whatever seed had not yet reached Pakistan would not reach Pakistan, and whatever was on the Pakistani side would stay there, and the two halves of the planting plan were now two separate plans, divided by a war.

Harold stood up from the stool. He folded it and put it under his arm and walked back to the station office and sat down at the table and opened the notebook and began to recalculate. The seed assigned to the Pakistani stations was sitting in a warehouse in Amritsar, on the Indian side, and it would sit there until the border opened, and the border would not open during the planting window. Harold took the Pakistani seed out of the Pakistani column and put it into the Indian column, adding plots where the land was prepared and the agronomists were ready, and the loss of Pakistan was, in the ledger, a gain for India, more seed per station, more hectares planted, the dead seed from the fumigation partially offset by the redistribution from the war.

The war was a fact, like the fumigation, like the customs delay, like the misspelled check at the bank in Mexico City. It was a thing that had happened to the work, an obstacle with a shape and a size that could be accommodated by adjusting the plan, and Harold adjusted the plan. The fighting was somewhere to the west, along the border, and the sound of it did not reach Ludhiana, and the station continued to operate, the men going to the field in the morning and returning in the evening, and the wheat grew in the plots, the green shoots thickening, tillering, the short plants filling in the gapped rows, and Harold watched them grow the way he watched anything grow, with patience and the notebook open.

Weeks passed. The border remained closed. A letter from the Foundation's office in Pakistan, forwarded through New York, said that the seed which had reached Pakistan before the border closed had been planted, that the Pakistani agronomists had proceeded with what they had. Harold read the letter and folded it and put it in the notebook. The seed was in the ground or it was not, and no letter could change it.

He traveled the Indian stations. Jeep rides along roads that were sometimes paved and sometimes not, the vehicle jolting through villages where the road narrowed to a single lane and the children ran alongside, and then the fields opening again. At each station Harold walked the plots and bent to the plants and touched the stems and pulled heads and rubbed the grain between his fingers and wrote in the notebook, and the plants were growing, the semi-dwarf varieties coming up shorter than anything the Indian agronomists had seen, the canopy at waist height when the tall varieties beside them were at the chest, and the short wheat was thick-stemmed and heavy-headed and the tall wheat was thin-stemmed and light-headed and the difference was a thing that did not require explanation.

The first application of fertilizer showed it. The tall varieties in the adjacent plots began to lean. The nitrogen pushed the growth and the stems, tall and slender, could not hold the weight, and the plants lodged, the stems bending at the base, the field going from upright to flattened in the space of a week, the way Harold had seen it happen a thousand times in the Yaqui Valley, and beside the lodged tall wheat the short wheat stood. The thick stems holding, the heads upright, the plants absorbing the nitrogen and converting it not into stem length but into grain, more tillers, more heads, more kernels per head, and the standing wheat beside the fallen wheat was an argument that required no words.

The officials came to see it. Men in white shirts and dark trousers, government men from the agricultural ministry and the planning commission, and they stood at the edges of the plots and looked at the short wheat standing and the tall wheat fallen, and Harold answered their questions, the yields he expected, the fertilizer response, the disease resistance, and the questions were the questions of men who were beginning to understand that what they were looking at was not an experiment but an answer, and the answer was in the field, growing.

The harvest came. Harold was there for it. He stood at the edge of a field near Ludhiana and watched the workers cut the short wheat by hand, the sickles low to the ground because the wheat was low to the ground, the bundles small and dense and heavy, the heads fat with grain, and the workers had to bend lower than they were used to, work closer to the ground, the adjustment visible in their posture, the deeper stoop, the shorter reach, and the bundles accumulated in the field, laid in rows to dry.

The threshing was done by machine at the station, the bundles fed into the thresher, the grain pouring into the sack, the chaff blowing, and the sack was weighed and the weight was recorded and the weight was higher than the tall varieties by thirty-five percent, the same range Harold had seen in the Yaqui Valley, the same advantage, confirmed now in soil he had never touched until six months ago, under a sky he had not known, and the number was in the notebook and the number was the number.

The reports that came in from the other stations said the same thing. Station after station, the same result, the short wheat outyielding the tall by the same margin, the same percentages appearing in the data from Karnal and Pantnagar and Kanpur and the stations in Pakistan where the seed had arrived before the war, the same numbers, a result Harold had first seen on a single plot in the Yaqui Valley now repeated across a subcontinent, and the repetition was the proof.

They drove through the Punjab on the last day before Harold's flight. Swaminathan drove, the jeep moving along a road that cut through wheat fields, and the fields went on in every direction, flat, green, and some of them were the demonstration plots, the short wheat visible from the road, standing a foot lower than the fields around it, and some were the farmers' own plantings, the tall wheat that would lodge when the rains came, and the two kinds of wheat lay across the landscape in patches, the new and the old, and the patches of the new were small, scattered, but they were there, the lower fields, the denser canopy, the heads that did not sway because the stems were too stiff to sway, and the jeep moved through the landscape and the wheat stretched to the horizon.

Harold looked at it the way he looked at anything, which was carefully, his eyes moving across the fields the way they moved across his own plots, assessing, and what he registered was the stand density and the tiller count and the color of the canopy and the stage of growth and the presence or absence of disease, the same things he always registered, and the fact that the fields went on for miles and that the wheat in some of them was his wheat, had come from his crosses, from his stool, from his hands, was a fact he registered the way he registered the others, as data, as a thing that was true and that went into the notebook.

The flight home was long. Delhi to London to New York to Mexico City, the hours accumulating, the time zones shifting, and Harold sat in his seat and did not read and did not sleep and the notebook was in his bag under the seat and the bag held the germination counts and the yield numbers and the plan for the next season's planting, and the plane carried all of it west.

Ruth was at the apartment. He came through the door in the evening, the bag over his shoulder, the clothes he had been wearing for two days, and Ruth was at the stove, the kitchen light on, and the apartment smelled of food, beans and rice and the smell of the tortillas warming on the comal, and Ruth turned from the stove and looked at him and her face did what it always did when he came home, which was nothing obvious, a slight shift, a softening that was not a smile but was adjacent to a smile, the expression of a woman receiving a thing she had been waiting for.

Bill was at the table. He was eight, nine, Harold could not always remember without calculating, and Harold put the bag down and sat and Bill said hi and Harold said hi and Ruth put a plate in front of him and Harold ate. The food was warm and the sounds of Mexico City came through the window, the traffic and the vendors and the radio from the apartment below, and Harold ate and Ruth sat across from him and Bill ate beside him and the three of them were at the table, the table where Harold had eaten a thousand meals between trips to the field, and the meal was the meal and Harold was home.

Ruth asked about the trip. She asked the way she always asked, which was briefly, one or two questions, not because she did not want to know but because she had learned that Harold answered briefly and that the answers he gave were the answers he had, and what he had seen and what he could say about what he had seen were not the same thing, had never been the same thing, and the distance between them was a distance she had lived with for the length of their marriage.

Harold said the seed had arrived in poor condition. He said they had replanted at double the rate. He said the harvest was good. He said this with the plate in front of him and the fork in his hand and the words were accurate and insufficient and the insufficiency was not a failure of language but a fact about Harold, about the space between what he carried and what he could put down, and Ruth heard the words and they were enough because they were what he had and she had long ago stopped waiting for more.

Jeanie was not there. She was in the United States, at a university, a young woman now, and her absence from the table was the absence that accumulates when children leave, not sharp but ambient, and the chair where she had sat was pushed in and the table was set for three.

Harold went back to the field. He flew to the Yaqui Valley and drove to the station and the station was there the way it was always there, the buildings and the plots and the canal and the flat valley floor stretching to the mountains, and Vega was there, at the table, the seed packets in front of him, the season's work laid out, and Harold came in and set the bag down and Vega looked up and said how was it.

Harold poured coffee and stood at the counter and drank it and said it was what they expected. He said the yields were good. He said the fumigation had cost them half the seed and the war had cost them Pakistan. He said these things the way he said everything, plainly, the facts delivered without emphasis, and Vega listened and nodded and did not ask about the war or the scale or what it meant that the wheat they had made in this valley was now growing across India, because Vega did not ask those questions, Vega asked about the seed and the planting and the next season, the questions of the work, and Harold answered them.

The stool was where Harold had left it, leaning against the wall inside the station door. He picked it up and carried it to the crossing block, the small plot at the south end of the station, and the new generation was there, the plants from the crosses he had made before he left, growing in their rows, the heads forming, approaching the stage when the anthers would be ready, the small green sacs inside the florets not yet mature, not yet yellow, the window approaching, and Harold unfolded the stool and set it in the row and sat down.

The stool settled into the dirt. The three legs found their positions, the slight unevenness of the ground accommodated by the slight give of the legs, and Harold sat and the wheat was at his hands, the heads at the height of his chest, the plants surrounding him in their rows, the canopy dense and green and still in the morning air. He took the tweezers from his shirt pocket. He took a head in his left hand, the head heavy with the grain that was forming inside the florets, and he trimmed the spikelets at the tip and the base with the scissors, the small blades cutting cleanly, the trimmed pieces falling into the dirt between his feet. He opened the first floret with the tweezers and found the anthers, three of them, small and green, and he pulled them out one by one, the tweezers gripping each sac and drawing it free of the floret, the motion precise, the motion he had made a hundred thousand times, the same motion, and the anther came out and he dropped it and reached for the next.

The canal murmured. The breeze came off the water and moved through the canopy and the heads swayed slightly and Harold held the head steady with his left hand and worked with his right and the notebook was on his knee and the pencil was behind his ear and the morning was warm and the light came down through the short canopy to the soil and the soil was dark with irrigation water and the field was quiet and Harold worked.
