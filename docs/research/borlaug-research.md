# Norman Borlaug: Deep Research Notes for Historical Fiction

## 1. THE WHEAT BREEDING PROCESS: Daily Work in Mexico

### The Physical Act of Crossing Wheat

The core work was emasculation -- removing the male parts (anthers/pollen sacs) from wheat flowers to prevent self-pollination, then introducing pollen from a selected father plant. The steps:

1. **Selection of the wheat head**: Choose a spike where the anthers are still small and green, with a tight stigma. If the anthers start turning slightly yellow, it is too late -- hand heat could cause premature pollen release.
2. **Trimming**: Using scissors or forceps, remove the spikelets at the tip and base of the spike (these develop asynchronously and are often sterile). Remove the center florets in each remaining spikelet, which also develop unevenly. Cut across each spikelet, leaving roughly two-thirds, to make both anther removal and pollination easier.
3. **Emasculation**: Pull out each anther one by one using fine tweezers/forceps. This was described as "a mind-numbing task when sitting on a stool in the field under a blazing sun with mosquitos and midges." The worker sits hunched on a stool in the field, peering at tiny flower parts, pulling delicate anthers with tweezers.
4. **Bagging**: Cover the emasculated head with a paper bag (kraft paper, parchment paper, or polyester bags were used) to prevent contamination from wind-blown foreign pollen.
5. **Pollination**: When the female parts (pistils) are receptive, 1-3 days after emasculation, trim the donor spike's spikelets at a 45-degree angle and insert the pollen donor into the bag with the emasculated spike. As the donor progresses through anthesis, pollen falls onto the waiting pistils.
6. **Record-keeping**: Every cross is recorded -- parentage, date, location, plot number. Meticulous notebooks.

### The Bird Boy Innovation

One of Borlaug's "Bird Boys" -- Reyes Vega -- revolutionized the process. Vega was "twice as fast as Borlaug at the mind-numbing task of removing pollen sacs." One day, Vega took a small pair of scissors and snipped off the wheat flower's glumes, exposing the entire interior so that all pollen sacs could be pulled out in one motion. He then discovered how to make male parents "produce copious amounts of pollen within minutes." This simplified and vastly sped up the entire crossing process.

### Scale of Operations

In his first ten years, Borlaug's group made 6,000 individual crossings of wheat. They "married" thousands of wheat parents yearly, while most breeders worldwide managed fewer than 200 per year. Working for Borlaug was described as "simultaneously being in the Peace Corps and in a Marine Corps boot camp." When wheat flowers are ready for cross-breeding, "you work from sun up to sun down." He worked "dawn to dusk, seven days a week, laboriously hand-pollinating millions of wheat plants."

### Tools and Equipment

- Fine-pointed tweezers/forceps for anther removal
- Small scissors for trimming glumes and spikelets
- Paper bags (kraft paper) for covering emasculated heads
- Low stools for sitting in the field
- Magnifying glasses for examining tiny flower parts
- Notebooks and pencils for meticulous record-keeping
- Junked tractors rebuilt from salvage yards near Mexico City -- mechanics Vicente Guerrero and his brother Jose made one usable tractor from three junked ones and built a combine from scratch
- No new farm machinery available due to WWII

## 2. THE PLACES

### The Yaqui Valley, Sonora (Winter Breeding Site)

- Located on the northwest coast of mainland Mexico, in the state of Sonora, on a coastal strip along the Gulf of California.
- A semi-arid irrigated region amidst desert scrub forest. To the east, semi-desert covered with scrub, mesquites, and cacti.
- Climate: Semi-arid, average precipitation 317 mm/year (mostly July-September). Average daily temperature 24C. Summer temperatures routinely exceed 40C (104F). Steppe climate with long, very hot summers and short, mild winters.
- The valley had been recently cleared of desert vegetation for new irrigation districts. Irrigation canals crisscross the valley, carrying water from the Oviachic (Alvaro Obregon) dam/reservoir, which captures the Yaqui River's flow about 40 km from Ciudad Obregon.
- In the 1940s, three epidemics of stem rust (1939-1941) had wiped out wheat in the valley.
- The experiment station was "in shambles" when Borlaug arrived in 1945. Borlaug and Joe Rupert "slept in the loft of a run-down state of Sonora research building, sharing it with rats, mice, mosquitoes and weevil-infested grain."
- Local farmer Cathy Jones gave them rides in her car so they could get supplies from nearby Obregon. Aureliano Campoy loaned them a tractor and equipment to use on Sundays, when he did not work.
- Later, Don Rodolfo Calles (former Sonora governor) championed Borlaug's work. Valley farmers, cooperatives, grain merchants, and banks collectively funded a 250-acre experiment station plus 600 additional acres through wheat production taxes.
- Borlaug said of the Yaqui Valley: "This is where I truly feel at home, and where I am at peace." A portion of his ashes were interred there after his death.

### Ciudad Obregon

- The nearest city to the Yaqui Valley research plots.
- In the 1940s, still transitioning from a small town to a regional center. Irrigation projects on the Yaqui River were completed in the 1950s, transforming vast areas into farmland.
- Located on main highways and railroads connecting Mexicali and Nogales to Mexico City.
- By mid-century: cotton gins, granaries, packing plants, an airport.

### The Toluca Valley / Chapingo (Summer Breeding Site)

- Located about 40 miles west of Mexico City at approximately 2,600 meters (8,500 feet) above sea level -- one of the highest valleys in Mexico.
- Surrounded by mountains, most imposing being the Nevado de Toluca volcano (4,690 m / 15,387 ft), the fourth highest mountain in Mexico.
- Semi-cold to cold climate despite tropical latitude. Average monthly temperature between 5C at higher altitudes and 20C in the valley floor.
- Broadleaf forests on piedmont hills, conifers on upper slopes, alpine grasslands (Zacatonal) at highest elevations.
- The valley floor had fertile soils, watered by the Lerma River.
- In the 1940s-1950s, still primarily agricultural -- 60% of the workforce engaged in farming in 1950.
- The initial Chapingo research station, outside Mexico City, "was in ruins, only a few small trial plantings were made and these were done by hand."

### The Contrast Between Sites

The two breeding locations differed by 8,500 feet in elevation and significantly in daylength. Obregon was sea-level desert heat; Toluca was high-altitude cold. This contrast was central to the shuttle breeding innovation: wheat that thrived in both locations had to be broadly adapted, which proved crucial for later international adoption.

### The Road Between

The distance between the two sites was approximately 1,000 km. In the 1940s-1950s, Mexican roads were rough, and the trip was arduous. Seed had to be transported between sites twice yearly.

## 3. PERSONAL LIFE

### Margaret Gibson Borlaug

- Born 1911, died March 8, 2007 (age 95) following a fall.
- Norman met Margaret while they both worked at a coffee shop in Dinkytown, the student neighborhood near the University of Minnesota campus.
- Married in 1937. They were married for 69 years.
- Margaret was described as "much more than Norman's love; she encouraged, counseled and enabled him. Simply put, Margaret was the foundation and the rudder for his incredible life's journey."
- In July 1944, Norman left Margaret -- who was pregnant -- and their 14-month-old daughter Jeanie to fly to Mexico City. He had rejected DuPont's offer to double his salary.
- Margaret eventually moved the family to Mexico City, where they lived for 40 years (until 1985).
- The shuttle breeding program to the distant Yaqui Valley meant "she and the family would be seeing less of Norman in the winter months."
- On the morning of the Nobel Prize (October 20, 1970), Norwegian officials called Margaret at 4 AM in Mexico City, but Norman had already left for the Toluca Valley fields. She drove for over an hour to find him. She said: "Someone from a newspaper in Oslo called right after you left this morning and said he urgently needed to talk to you. He said you've won the Nobel Peace Prize!" He replied: "No, I haven't." According to daughter Jeanie: "It took some convincing. He thought the whole thing was a hoax." He said he could not come to the phone because he and his assistants still had much more work to do. He went back to recording data on his test plots.

### Children

- **Norma Jean "Jeanie" Laube**: First child, born approximately 1943 (she was 14 months old when Borlaug left for Mexico in July 1944).
- **Scott Gibson "Scotty" Borlaug**: Born November 7, 1944, in Wilmington, Delaware. Born with spina bifida. A telegram arrived at the end of November 1944 informing Borlaug that Margaret had given birth to a boy with spina bifida. For three agonizing days, Norm waited for a flight back to Wilmington. Physicians told them nothing could be done. Margaret and Norman made burial arrangements, and at Margaret's urging, he returned to Mexico. Scotty died December 10, 1945.
- **William "Bill" Borlaug**: Born later; settled in Dallas, Texas.

### Norwegian-American Upbringing in Cresco, Iowa

- Born March 25, 1914, in his grandfather's farmhouse near the Norwegian-American hamlet of Saude in northeast Iowa, Howard County. Nearest town: Cresco (12 miles away), the county seat.
- Descendant of the Borlaug, Vaala, Swenumson, and Landsverk families who immigrated from Norway in the mid-1800s.
- Raised on a non-mechanized, subsistence 106-acre family farm west of Protivin. From age 7 to 19, he worked the farm: fishing, hunting, raising corn, oats, timothy-grass, cattle, pigs, and chickens.
- Attended a one-room schoolhouse with mixed Lutheran Norwegian and Czech Catholic students.
- Described as a "Norman Rockwell-esque farm" childhood.
- First in his family to pursue university education.

### Wrestling

- At Cresco High School (1929-1932), Borlaug wrestled, played football and baseball.
- His wrestling coach, Dave Bartelma, continually encouraged him to "give 105%."
- Bartelma later became head wrestling coach at the University of Minnesota, and Borlaug followed him there.
- Wrestled at 145 pounds at Minnesota; reached the Big Ten semifinals.
- Inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame.
- Borlaug reflected: "Wrestling taught me some valuable lessons. I always figured I could hold my own against the best in the world. It made me tough."

### University of Minnesota

- Applied in 1933, failed the entrance exam, but was accepted into the newly created two-year General College.
- Worked his way through: waited tables at a coffee shop, served meals in a sorority house, parked cars, labored for 50 cents a day as a hired farm hand.
- During Depression years, his "breakfast was a cup of coffee, two pieces of toast and six prunes" as payment for work. He and Margaret were perpetually hungry students.
- In 1936, broke again, got a job with the Civilian Conservation Corps at $100/month, hitchhiked from Minnesota to New Haven, Connecticut. The young men in his CCC unit were visibly malnourished. Seeing the change in their health and morale as they began to eat regularly -- many for the first time -- made an indelible impression.
- Witnessed a bloody fight on the streets of Minneapolis during the Depression, which convinced him that "hunger leads to violence."
- In the last months of his undergraduate education, attended a Sigma Xi lecture by Elvin Stakman on "These Shifty Little Enemies that Destroy our Food Crops," about rust disease. This lecture redirected his career.
- Earned B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota, all under Stakman's influence.

### DuPont (1942-1944)

- Worked as a microbiologist at DuPont in Wilmington, Delaware.
- Was to lead research on industrial and agricultural bactericides, fungicides, and preservatives.
- Tried to enlist after Pearl Harbor but was kept at DuPont for war service.
- Turned down DuPont's offer to double his salary to go to Mexico.

## 4. THE SCIENCE

### Stem Rust (Puccinia graminis)

- A parasitic fungus that feeds on phytonutrients in wheat, oats, and barley.
- Spores travel through the air, land on wheat plants, cause brown/orange lesions.
- "Bright-orange, 'rusty' pustules occur on the wheat leaf surface and stems containing up to 350,000 urediniospores."
- Under favorable conditions, "the fungus produces so many urediniospores that they form huge orange clouds above the fields and quickly infect every single plant."
- The fungus interferes with a plant's ability to move water and nutrients from soils through the stem into leaves.
- It causes breakage, desiccation, and shriveling of the grain.
- Three epidemics of stem rust (1939-1941) wiped out wheat in the Yaqui Valley.
- Race 15B emerged as a devastating new pathogenic race around 1954, threatening nearly all Mexican breeding lines.

### Shuttle Breeding

- Borlaug's revolutionary innovation: growing wheat in two locations per year instead of one.
- Summer: high-altitude Chapingo/Toluca Valley near Mexico City (cool, short days).
- Winter: low-altitude Yaqui Valley in Sonora (hot, long days).
- Two generations per year when other breeders produced one.
- Opposition was fierce: Professor H.K. Hayes (Minnesota's consultant) and Director Harrar said it was "unorthodox," that seeds needed a year of "rest," and that it was "too expensive."
- Only Stakman's intervention prevented Borlaug from resigning over the dispute. Stakman gave him the go-ahead.
- The unintended bonus: wheat that thrived at both locations was photoperiod-insensitive and broadly adapted, which later proved essential for adoption across diverse global environments.

### The Norin 10 Dwarfing Genes

- In 1935, Japanese scientist Gonjiro Inazuka crossed a semi-dwarf Japanese wheat landrace with American varieties, producing Norin 10.
- Norin 10 carried the Rht1 and Rht2 genes, reducing plant height from over 150 cm to 60-110 cm.
- Orville Vogel at Washington State University used Norin 10 to produce high-yielding semi-dwarf winter wheat, including the variety Gaines.
- In 1953, Borlaug wrote to Vogel requesting seed with Norin 10 dwarfing genes. Vogel sent Norin 10/Brevor 14 crosses.
- Borlaug crossed these with his disease-resistant Mexican varieties.
- The shorter, stiffer stems meant the plants could absorb more fertilizer without falling over ("lodging"), and they tillered profusely, producing more grain per head.
- Dwarfism is caused by a complex of recessive genes, many linked to undesirable traits -- separating the good from bad took years of painstaking crosses.

### Key Wheat Varieties Developed

- **Kentana** and **Yaqui 48**: Early successes adopted by farmers.
- **Lerma 52**: Resistant to Race 15B stem rust but produced poor flour quality.
- **Lerma 52 x Newthatch**: Solved the quality problem by crossing with a Minnesota bread wheat.
- **Pitic 62** and **Penjamo 62** (1962): First semi-dwarf releases. "Changed the potential yield of spring wheat dramatically."
- **Sonora 64** and **Lerma Rojo 64** (1964): Led the Green Revolution in India and Pakistan.
- **Siete Cerros 66**, **INIA 66**, **Sonalika**, **Yecora 70**: Later varieties.
- By 1963, 95% of Mexico's wheat crops used Borlaug's semi-dwarf varieties. The harvest was six times larger than in 1944.

### Green Revolution Timeline

- 1944: Borlaug arrives in Mexico.
- 1948: First improved varieties (Kentana, Yaqui 48) released.
- 1953: Begins crossing with Norin 10 dwarf wheat.
- 1956: Mexico achieves wheat self-sufficiency. Wheat production up 14-fold since 1944.
- 1962: Pitic 62 and Penjamo 62 released.
- 1963: 95% of Mexico's wheat is Borlaug's varieties.
- 1965: 450 tons of seed shipped to India (200 tons) and Pakistan (250 tons). Seed shipment plagued by customs delays, a 30-truck convoy, the Watts riots closing the LA freeway, a bank refusing to honor Pakistan's $100,000 check due to three misspelled words, and over-fumigation killing half the seeds at Indian customs. Despite this, seeds were planted.
- 1966: India imports 18,000 tons of seed (largest seed purchase in world history). Pakistan imports 42,000 tons.
- 1967: Harvests explode. Pakistan self-sufficient in wheat by 1968.
- 1970: India wheat yield rises from 12.3 million tons (1965) to 20.1 million tons. Borlaug wins Nobel Peace Prize.
- 1974: India self-sufficient in all cereals.

- Gave the "Shifty Little Enemies" lecture that changed Borlaug's direction.
- Later served as Rockefeller Foundation consultant.
- Admired Borlaug's "intelligence, stamina, and determination," saying: "He will not be defeated by difficulty and he burns with a missionary zeal."
- Intervened to prevent Borlaug from resigning, gave him the green light for shuttle breeding.
- Mentored both Harrar and Borlaug; sometimes called "the Godfather of the Green Revolution."

### J. George "Dutch" Harrar

- Director of the Rockefeller Foundation's Mexican Project.
- Plant pathologist.
- Recruited Borlaug on Stakman's recommendation, even though Borlaug had no wheat experience.
- Had a complicated relationship with Borlaug -- opposed shuttle breeding as "unorthodox" and too expensive. Said seeds needed a year of "rest."

## 6. THE STRUGGLES

### Early Failures and Despair

- "It often appeared to me that I had made a dreadful mistake in accepting the position in Mexico."
- Lacked trained personnel, equipment, and institutional support.
- Suffered dysentery and nausea upon arriving in Mexico.
- Was "struck by the primitive state of agriculture, the poverty, lack of education and general hopelessness."
- The Chapingo station was in ruins. No equipment. WWII meant no new farm machinery in Mexico.

### Farmer Resistance

- Mexican peasants were "initially hostile" to improving their agricultural practices.
- One farmer claimed a steel plow would take all the "warmth" out of the soil and make it infertile. He later turned cattle onto the field so the animals could put "heat" back into his land.
- Borlaug's strategy of giving improved seed directly to farmers eventually won them over: "On Farm-Demonstration is a powerful persuader."

### Professional Opposition

- Professor H.K. Hayes and Director Harrar both opposed shuttle breeding.
- Harrar said it was too expensive and unorthodox.
- Borlaug nearly resigned. Threatened to leave in a meeting: "We can't produce the wheat that Mexico needs just in the Yaqui Valley or in Sinaloa. We've got to work in all the areas where wheat wasn't an important crop, especially the Bajillo, and if I'm not permitted to do that, I'll leave."
- Only Stakman's intervention saved the program.

### Political Threats

- In 1954, political movements threatened deportation of Rockefeller Foundation staff from Mexico.
- Resolved through intervention by Stakman, Calles, and Foundation officials.

### The 1965 Seed Shipment Disaster

- Mexican customs held up the first shipment; it could not be shipped from Guaymas port in time.
- A 30-truck convoy had to transport seed from Mexico to Los Angeles.
- Delayed at the Mexico-U.S. border.
- The U.S. National Guard had closed the freeway due to the Watts riots in Los Angeles.
- A Mexican bank refused to honor Pakistan treasury's payment of $100,000 because the check contained three misspelled words.
- Borlaug lost his temper: "Get that wheat aboard the ship and send it on its damn way!"
- Half the seeds were killed by over-fumigation at Indian customs.
- Indian state monopolies lobbied against the shipment.
- Seeds germinated at only half the expected rate; seeding rates had to be doubled.

### Natural Disasters

- A massive Yaqui Valley flood destroyed stored seeds and killed two loyal staff members who drowned trying to rescue seed stocks.

### Physical and Emotional Toll

- Years of working bent over in fields, dawn to dusk, seven days a week.
- Long separations from family.
- The death of his infant son Scotty from spina bifida while he was in Mexico.
- Suffered dysentery and nausea.
- His disdain for paperwork and budgets was "legendary."
- He was "never a man comfortable with bureaucracy."

## 8. HISTORICAL CONTEXT

### Mexico in the 1940s

- President Manuel Avila Camacho (1940-1946) sought to modernize Mexican farming and bolster the economy.
- Mexico was importing a large portion of its wheat.
- Widespread rural poverty, malnutrition, and primitive subsistence farming.
- The Rockefeller Foundation and Nelson Rockefeller funded the agricultural program partly to "stabilise Mexico against potential communist attraction to starving people."
- U.S. Vice President Henry Wallace visited Mexico in 1940 and was instrumental in convincing the Rockefeller Foundation to support the effort.

### The Rockefeller Foundation's Mexican Agricultural Program (MAP)

- Established in 1943 as a joint venture between the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture.
- Known as the Office of Special Studies (Oficina de Estudios Especiales).
- Covered genetics, plant breeding, plant pathology, entomology, agronomy, soil science, and cereal technology.
- The program achieved extraordinary results: Mexico tripled its wheat production in its first twenty years. Mexico became wheat self-sufficient by 1956.
- Eventually became CIMMYT (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center), based in Ciudad Obregon.

### The Wider World

- WWII was raging when Borlaug arrived in 1944. No new farm equipment available.
- The Cold War shaped the political dynamics of agricultural aid.
- India-Pakistan war in 1965 -- Borlaug worked "within sound of artillery fire" during seed distribution.
- The Watts riots in Los Angeles (August 1965) delayed the critical seed shipment.
- Paul Ehrlich's "The Population Bomb" (1968) predicted mass starvation -- Borlaug proved him wrong.
- Borlaug fought against "the constant pessimism and scare-mongering of critics and skeptics who predicted that, in spite of his efforts, mass starvation was inevitable."

### Key Dates

- 1943: Rockefeller Foundation agreement with Mexican government.
- 1944: Borlaug arrives in Mexico City.
- 1956: Mexico wheat self-sufficient.
- 1960: Borlaug surveys North Africa, Middle East, South Asia for the FAO.
- 1962: First semi-dwarf varieties released.
- 1965-66: Massive seed shipments to India and Pakistan.
- October 20, 1970: Nobel Peace Prize awarded.
- 1985: Borlaug and Margaret return to the USA.
- March 8, 2007: Margaret dies at age 95.
- September 12, 2009: Norman Borlaug dies at age 95 in Dallas, Texas.
- March 25, 2010: Monument dedicated in Yaqui Valley. Names of six varieties stamped in the base: Pitic 62, Lerma Rojo 64, Siete Cerros 66, INIA 66, Sonalika, Yecora 70.

## 9. KEY ANECDOTES FOR FICTION

### The CCC Revelation
Between university terms, Borlaug led a Civilian Conservation Corps unit. Many of the young men were visibly malnourished. Seeing the change in their health and morale as they began eating regularly -- many for the first time in their lives -- made an indelible impression that shaped his life's work.

### The Minneapolis Riot
A bloody fight on the streets of Minneapolis during the Great Depression convinced Borlaug that "hunger leads to violence, and that peace could not be achieved without abundant food."

### The Milk Strikes
During the Depression, dairy farmers dumped their product during "milk strikes," desperate to raise prices, even as people went hungry. The irony scarred him.

### The Walk-Out
At a meeting where he was denied permission to expand wheat work beyond the Yaqui Valley, Borlaug stood and said: "We can't produce the wheat that Mexico needs just in the Yaqui Valley or in Sinaloa. We've got to work in all the areas... and if I'm not permitted to do that, I'll leave." When he got to the door, Joe Rupert stood up and walked out with him.

### The Telegram
A telegram arrived in late November 1944 telling Borlaug that Margaret had given birth to a boy with spina bifida. For three agonizing days, he waited for a flight back to Wilmington, Delaware.

### The Nobel Prize Morning
October 20, 1970: Norwegian officials called Margaret at 4 AM. Norman had already left for the fields. She drove over an hour to Toluca Valley. He was harvesting with five scientists from Romania, Brazil, and Mexico. She told him. He said, "No, I haven't." He wanted to keep working.

### The Wheat Shipment Crisis
The 1965 shipment to India and Pakistan: customs delays, a 30-truck convoy, the Watts riots, a bank refusing a misspelled check, over-fumigation killing half the seeds. Borlaug shouting: "Get that wheat aboard the ship and send it on its damn way!"

### The Warm Soil
A Mexican farmer told Borlaug that a steel plow would take all the "warmth" out of his soil. He later turned cattle onto the field so the animals could put "heat" back into his land.
