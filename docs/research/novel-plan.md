# THE CROSSING — Novel Plan

## Working Title
**The Crossing** — refers to wheat crossing, the crossing between the two breeding sites (Yaqui Valley and Toluca), the crossing between self and work, the crossing between what is said and what is felt.

## THE CHARACTER

### Name: **Harold Lindgren**

Norwegian-American. "Lindgren" is a common Scandinavian surname — unremarkable, forgettable, the name of a man who disappears into his work. "Harold" — old-fashioned, solid, a name that belongs to someone's grandfather. Not heroic. Not literary.

### The Composite

Harold carries Borlaug's biography but Matt's and Abigail's psychology:

**From Borlaug:** The Iowa farm, the wrestling, the University of Minnesota, the marriage to a woman he met in a coffee shop, the departure for Mexico in 1944, the wheat breeding, the shuttle between Yaqui Valley and Toluca, the Bird Boys, the stool, the tweezers, the bags, the years. The dead infant son. The wife who drives an hour to tell him he's won something he doesn't believe he's won.

**From Matt:** The compartmentalization. Harold is never altogether himself in any one place. In the fields he is fully alive in a way his wife cannot access. At home he performs a version of tenderness that is real but incomplete. He does not get angry. He is relentlessly patient, agreeable, good — and this costs him something he cannot name. His busyness (the 16-hour days, the obsessive crossing schedule, the shuttle between sites) functions the same way Matt's sexual activity does: it prevents him from having to sit still with the person he loves and feel whatever it is he cannot feel. He is always in motion.

**From Abigail:** The absent father. Harold's father was a man who worked the Iowa farm and said nothing. Not cruel — absent in the way of men who have no language for what they feel. Harold is always talking to his father in his head. Not consciously. It surfaces in the work: the compulsive need to prove something, the refusal to quit, the "I get to do this, and you can't stop me" stubbornness that others read as heroism but which is really a private revenge drama against a man who never said he was proud. Each successful wheat cross is Harold winning an argument with someone who isn't in the room.

### What Harold Does NOT Know About Himself

- That his work is a substitute for intimacy
- That his patience is a form of suppression
- That his devotion to the Mexican farm boys (the Bird Boys) is a re-enactment of the fathering he didn't receive
- That his wife sees all of this and has chosen to accept it
- That his anger, when it finally surfaces (the walk-out scene, the seed shipment crisis), is not about wheat

### Harold's Wife: **Ruth**

Ruth is Margaret Borlaug reimagined through the lens of the source material. She is not a saint. She is a woman who has made a calculation: she would rather have this partial version of Harold than not have him at all. She understands something about him that he does not understand about himself. She does not say it. This is her form of love — or her form of loss. The novel does not decide.

### Supporting Characters

- **Vega** — Based on Reyes Vega. The Bird Boy who becomes the best breeder in the program. His relationship with Harold is the closest thing Harold has to a friendship — but it exists entirely within the work. They understand each other through wheat.
- **Rupert** — Based on Joe Rupert. The colleague who walks out of the meeting with Harold. A combat veteran. Laconic. The one person who sees Harold's anger as real.
- **Harrar** — The director. Represents institutional authority. Harold's relationship with him is where the suppressed anger lives.

## STRUCTURE

The novel is organized around the **wheat breeding calendar** — the shuttle between the Yaqui Valley (winter) and the Toluca Valley (summer). Each section covers a growing season. Time passes. The work repeats. The repetition IS the structure.

### Part One: ARRIVAL (1944-1945)
Harold arrives in Mexico. The ruined station. The rats. The heat. The broken equipment. His wife is pregnant in Delaware. He learns to cross wheat. The telegram about his son.

**Chapters:**
1. **The Loft** — Harold and Rupert arrive at the Yaqui Valley station. The run-down building, the rats, the mosquitoes. The first days in the field. Establishing the physical world.
2. **The Stool** — The daily work of wheat crossing. Learning emasculation. The tweezers, the bags, the sun. The Bird Boys appear. The monotony. The heat.
3. **The Telegram** — Harold receives word about his son. Three days waiting for a flight. The burial arrangements. Margaret tells him to go back. He goes back.

### Part Two: THE CROSSING (1946-1953)
Harold invents shuttle breeding. The opposition. The work intensifies. Ruth moves to Mexico City. The family assembles around the edges of his obsession.

**Chapters:**
4. **The Road** — The 1,000 km between sites. The seed in the truck. The contrast between desert heat and mountain cold. Harold's body moving between worlds.
5. **The Marriages** — The Bird Boys learn to cross wheat. Vega's innovation with the scissors. The speed increases. Thousands of crosses. The language of "wheat marriages."
6. **Sunday** — A day at home in Mexico City. Ruth, the children. Harold tries to be present. The rituals of domestic life — cooking, the children's games. What he cannot do.

### Part Three: THE DWARF (1953-1962)
The Norin 10 seeds arrive from Washington. Harold crosses them with his Mexican varieties. Years of failure, then the semi-dwarf breakthrough. The plants that don't fall over.

**Chapters:**
7. **The Envelope** — Harold writes to Vogel. The seeds arrive. Small, unpromising. He begins the crosses. The dwarfing genes are recessive, linked to bad traits. Years of separating good from bad.
8. **Lodging** — The tall plants fall over when fertilized. The short plants stand. Harold in the field, measuring. The revelation that changes everything — rendered as a day's work, not as triumph.
9. **The Walk-Out** — Harold is denied permission to expand. He stands up. "If I'm not permitted to do that, I'll leave." Rupert follows him out. The anger that has been building for a decade.

### Part Four: THE SHIPMENT (1963-1966)
Mexico achieves self-sufficiency. Harold is asked to save India and Pakistan. The disastrous seed shipment. The Watts riots. The misspelled check. The fumigated seeds.

**Chapters:**
10. **The Convoy** — Thirty trucks. The customs delay. The border. The freeway closed by riots in a city Harold has never been to. The bank refusing a check because of three misspelled words.
11. **Fumigation** — Half the seeds are dead. Harold in a field in Pakistan, within sound of artillery, re-seeding at double the rate. The work continues. It always continues.

### Part Five: THE PRIZE (1970)
The phone call at 4 AM. Ruth drives an hour to the Toluca Valley. Harold is recording data. He says: "No, I haven't." He goes back to work.

**Chapters:**
12. **The Morning** — The final chapter. Ruth driving through the valley. Harold bent over his plants. The conversation. He returns to the stool. The novel ends where it has always been: in the field, in the heat, in the work.

## STYLE PRINCIPLES (from Knausgaard, adapted)

1. **Sentences that breathe.** Forward-moving, loping. Commas, not semicolons. Additions that feel like thought continuing.
2. **Accumulation of real detail.** Not one perfect detail — twenty ordinary ones. The reader inhabits the space.
3. **Past tense.** Immediacy comes from density of physical detail, not tense.
4. **Emotion rendered physically.** The body carries the feeling. The prose does not editorialize.
5. **No self-awareness in the character.** Harold does not know what we know. He does not reflect on his psychology. He works.
6. **Philosophical reflection emerging from action.** The thinking is embedded in the doing.
7. **Repetition as structure.** The same actions recur across seasons. This IS life.
8. **Long paragraphs.** Sustained immersion. No easy in-and-out.

### WHAT WE DO NOT DO
- Timestamp anything precisely
- Use weird hyper-specificity (no "60hz hum")
- Hedge with "perhaps/maybe/perhaps"
- Describe the character to the reader
- Have the character describe himself
- Analyze or commentate
- Reveal awareness of broader impact
- Use: flourescent, neon, ghost, spirit, echo, whisper
- Use names: Marcus, Chen
- Make it heroic or inspirational
- Tell the reader what to feel
- Explain the Green Revolution

## THE RULE

The reader who knows history will understand what Harold's work means for the world. The reader who doesn't will understand what it means for Harold. The novel serves both without serving either.
