# Chapter 2: The Stool

The stool was eighteen inches high, made of rough pine, with three legs and a seat that had been worn smooth by someone else's use, and it was too low for him, so that when he sat on it his knees came up almost to his chest and his back curved forward and his neck bent down and after an hour in this position the muscles along his spine began to tighten and after two hours they burned and after three they stopped burning and became something else, a kind of dull fixed ache that was no longer pain exactly but a new condition of the body, the way it was now, the way it would be for as long as he sat there, which was all day, which was every day.

He had found the stool in the shed behind the station, under a pile of broken crates and baling wire, and he had carried it out to the test plots on the first morning of real work and set it down between the rows and sat on it and looked at the wheat. The plants were knee-high, a pale green that would darken as they matured, and the heads were just beginning to emerge from the boot, the leaf sheath splitting open to reveal the compact spike of florets within, and this was the moment he had been waiting for, the narrow window when the flowers were still immature, the anthers small and green and tight against the stigma, before the pollen ripened and the plant pollinated itself and the opportunity was lost. He had days, not weeks. In this heat, less than days.

Rupert worked beside him, on an overturned bucket because there was only one stool, and they worked in silence, bent over separate rows, the sun on their backs, the sound of the irrigation canal somewhere behind them, a low murmur that after the first hour became inaudible the way all constant sounds become inaudible. Harold held a wheat head in his left hand, the stem pinched between his thumb and forefinger, and with a small pair of scissors he trimmed the spikelets at the tip of the head, two of them, and then two at the base, because these developed unevenly, and then he trimmed the top third of each remaining spikelet, cutting across the glumes to expose the interior of the floret, the pale chamber where the reproductive parts were housed. He set the scissors down beside the stool, in the same place every time, and picked up the tweezers, fine-pointed forceps he had brought from Wilmington, and he held the trimmed spikelet open with his left thumb and with the tweezers in his right hand he reached in and grasped the first anther, a tiny green sac no larger than a grain of rice, and pulled it out. Then the next. Then the third. Three anthers per floret. He moved to the next spikelet and did it again. And again. Fourteen spikelets, two florets each, three anthers each, eighty-four anthers per head, eighty-four times he reached in with the tweezers and grasped and pulled, and if he touched the anther too hard it would burst and release its pollen and the cross was ruined and he would have to find another head and begin again.

This was called emasculation. The word had a clinical quality that did not match the experience of doing it, which was not clinical at all but physical, a thing done with the hands and the eyes and the back and the neck, requiring a steadiness that came not from concentration, because you could not concentrate for eight hours, but from something closer to resignation, a surrender of the mind to the task, the way a man walking a long distance stops thinking about the distance and thinks instead about the next step, or stops thinking altogether and just walks. Harold did not think about eighty-four anthers. He thought about the one he was pulling. He watched it come free and he set it aside and he reached for the next.

When the head was clean he bagged it. He took a small bag made of kraft paper, tan-colored, the size of his hand, and slipped it over the emasculated head and folded the open end shut and fastened it with a paper clip. The bag would keep out foreign pollen, and the head would sit like that for a day or two or three, sealed in its paper tent, while the pistils matured and became receptive, and then he would come back and open the bag and introduce the pollen from the plant he had chosen as the father, the other half of the cross, and close the bag again and wait, and if the pollen took, the seeds that formed would carry the traits of both parents, the disease resistance of one and the yield of the other, or the stem strength of one and the maturity time of the other, or some combination that no one could predict, that would reveal itself only when the seeds were planted and grown and tested, months later, years later.

He wrote everything down. In a notebook he kept in his shirt pocket, a small spiral-bound notebook with a cardboard cover that softened and curled in the humidity, he recorded the date, the plot number, the row, the head, the variety of the mother plant and the variety of the intended father, and any observations, the color of the anthers, the condition of the stigma, whether the bag had held or whether the wind had torn it. The pencil was a short stub that he kept in the same pocket, and the graphite smeared in the sweat of his fingers so that by the end of the day the pages were smudged and barely legible and he had to go over it again in the evening, at the table in the station, copying the day's records into a larger ledger in a cleaner hand. This was the work no one saw, the work that happened after the work, and he did it every night, without exception, even when his back was so stiff from the stool that he could not sit upright and had to stand at the table, bent over the ledger the way he had been bent over the wheat, as if his body had learned only one shape.

The heat was the thing. Everything else could be managed, but the heat was ungovernable. It built through the morning, the air thickening, the light hardening, the ground radiating back what it had absorbed until by noon the sweat ran down his face and dripped off his chin onto the plants and onto his hands and the world shrank to the small circle of shade under his hat brim and the wheat head in his fingers and the tweezers and the tiny green anthers he was pulling one by one. His shirt was soaked through by midmorning and stayed soaked until evening. He drank water constantly, warm water from a canteen that hung from the stool, and the water tasted of metal and dust and was never cold and was never enough, and the thirst was always there, a low insistent presence, like the heat itself, something you carried rather than solved.

The mosquitoes were worse in the morning and again in the evening, but the midges were constant, the tiny black flies that landed on his neck and his ears and the backs of his hands and bit without his feeling it, so that he would look down and see a spot of blood on his knuckle and know he had been bitten minutes ago without noticing because his attention had been on the anther, on the tweezers, on the small operation happening between his fingers. By the end of the first week his forearms were covered in red welts that itched at night so badly he scratched them in his sleep, and in the morning the welts had been opened and there was blood on the sheets and Rupert looked at him and said nothing, and Harold did not check Rupert's arms because checking would have meant acknowledging it as a problem and it was not a problem, it was a condition, like the heat, like the ache in his back, like the distance from Ruth.

The boys appeared in the second week. Harold had asked the manager of a nearby farm, a man named Campoy, whether there were any young men in the area who could work, and two days later four of them showed up at the station in the early morning, standing in the yard by the canal. They were young, fifteen or sixteen, thin in the way of boys who had worked since childhood, their arms ropy and dark from the sun, and they wore cotton trousers and huaraches and shirts that had been washed so many times the fabric was nearly transparent. They did not speak English. Harold's Spanish was rudimentary, built from a phrasebook and a handful of words he had picked up from farmers along the canal, and he used these now, gesturing, explaining what he needed, which was for them to walk the test plots and chase the birds.

The birds were a problem he had not anticipated. Sparrows, finches, blackbirds, they came in flocks at dawn and again in late afternoon and landed on the wheat heads and ate the grain and pulled at the paper bags and sometimes tore them open, destroying crosses that had taken an hour of work. The boys' job was to walk the rows and clap their hands and shout, keep the birds moving, a task that required no skill and that the boys understood immediately because they had grown up on farms and had been chasing birds from crops since they could walk. They spread out across the field, four in a line, and moved through the rows with a loose unhurried energy, clapping, calling out, and the birds rose in ragged clusters and resettled further down and the boys followed and the birds rose again, a slow migration back and forth that had its own rhythm.

After three days one of the boys drifted over to where Harold was working and stood behind him and watched. Harold did not turn around. He could feel the boy there, the presence of him, the shadow falling across the row, and he kept working, trimming the spikelets, pulling the anthers, bagging the head, reaching for the next plant. The boy watched for a long time, twenty minutes, thirty, standing perfectly still, and then he squatted down on his heels the way farmers squat, the way Harold's father had squatted in the fields in Iowa, a low balanced crouch that could be held for hours, and he watched Harold's hands, and Harold let him watch.

The boy's name was Vega. Harold learned this later, when the names sorted themselves out from the general confusion of the first days. There was Vega and there was a boy called Tomás and two brothers whose names Harold could not initially distinguish because they were always together and answered to the same gesture. Vega was not the oldest or the largest. He was quiet, which Harold noticed because the others were not, the others talked and laughed and called to each other across the rows, but Vega was quiet in the way that Harold's father had been quiet, not withholding but watching, taking things in through the eyes and the hands rather than through speech.

On the fourth day Harold handed Vega the tweezers. He did this without thinking about it, the way you hand a tool to someone who is standing next to you and looking at the work. He held up a trimmed spikelet and pointed to the anthers and mimed pulling them out, and Vega took the tweezers and held them between thumb and forefinger and reached into the spikelet and grasped the first anther and pulled it free. He did it cleanly. He did it again. The boy's fingers were thinner than Harold's, the nails short and dark with soil, and the tweezers looked different in his grip, more natural, the way some tools fit some hands better than others, and he moved through the floret without hesitating, three anthers in three motions, and he looked up at Harold and Harold nodded and Vega bent his head and continued.

Harold went back to his own row. He sat on the stool and picked up his spare tweezers, the ones from the kit, and he worked, and beside him, squatting in the dirt, Vega worked, and they did not speak because they did not share a language and because there was nothing to say that the work did not say for them.

By the end of that first week Vega was faster than Harold. Not by much, not yet, but the difference was there, visible in the way the boy's hands moved, a fluidity that Harold's hands did not have, his own fingers being thicker, stiffer, trained to the coarser work of Iowa farming, the hay bales and the fence posts, while Vega's hands had been trained to nothing but were learning this, and learning it the way children learn, without the interference of knowing how difficult it was. Harold's father had been the same way with certain tasks, the milking, the sharpening of blades, work that his hands performed with an ease that seemed unearned because it had been earned so long ago the earning was no longer visible, and Harold had watched his father's hands the way Vega now watched his, and what passed between them in that watching was not instruction exactly but a transfer that happened below language, in the body, in the way one pair of hands learned from another simply by being near them.

He taught the other boys too. He brought a second stool from Obregon, a wooden crate that he nailed legs onto, and a third that was just an upended bucket with a board across it, and he sat them down in the rows and gave them tweezers and showed them. He explained the crosses as marriages. This was Rupert's idea, tell them it is the same thing, you are choosing a mother and a father and making a child, and Harold had thought this was too simple but it worked, the boys understood immediately, the idea of selecting for traits, of wanting the calf to have the mother's size and the father's strength, and they transferred this to the wheat without difficulty. Tomás called it a wedding, and after that they all called it that, the crosses were weddings, and when a bag was fastened over an emasculated head Tomás would say something in Spanish that made the other boys laugh, a joke about what happened after the ceremony, and Harold let them laugh because laughter in a wheat field under that sun was not something to be discouraged.

The days accumulated. Harold was up before dawn, standing by the canal with his coffee, and then the walk to the plots, the stool, the scissors, the tweezers, the first head of the day, the trimming, the emasculation, the bagging, the recording, and then the next head and the next, the boys arriving, Vega already squatting in his row before the others had reached the field, the sun climbing, the heat building, the water from the canteen, the mosquitoes, the midges, the birds rising and resettling, the clapping of the boys' hands, the slow progression down the row, head by head, plant by plant, the notebook filling, the pencil wearing down, the hours passing not as hours but as heads, as anthers, as bags, twelve in a morning, fifteen, eighteen if the plants were cooperative and his hands were steady and nothing went wrong.

Things went wrong. Anthers burst. Bags tore in the wind. Crosses that should have taken were empty when he opened the bags days later, the stigma dry and unfertilized, the head barren, and there was nothing to be learned from it except that it had not worked and that he would try again. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it did not and the ratio of success to failure was not something he could control, only shift, incrementally, over time, through the accumulation of small adjustments that lived in his hands, in the way his fingers learned the particular pressure needed to grasp an anther without crushing it, in the way his eyes learned to judge the readiness of a stigma by its color and the way its surface caught the light.

He thought about his father. Not in the way of missing him, but as a presence in the work, a way of holding the body that Harold had absorbed without being taught it. His father had planted corn the same way Harold planted wheat, row by row, year by year, with the same patience and the same silence and the same refusal to acknowledge that the work was hard, because acknowledging it would have been a kind of complaint and complaint was not something his father did, not out of stoicism, which implies a philosophy, but out of a simpler inability, the way some people cannot sing or cannot draw, and so the dissatisfaction, if it existed, went somewhere else, into the soil, into the silence between them. Harold sat on the stool in the heat and pulled anthers from wheat heads and did not complain, and if someone had asked him why he would not have said anything about his father, because the connection was not something he had thought, it was something he was.

Vega discovered the scissors technique on a Tuesday, though Harold did not note it as a Tuesday or as a discovery. He looked up from his own row and saw that Vega had picked up the small scissors and was snipping the glumes off the spikelet, not trimming across the top the way Harold did, but cutting down the sides, peeling the glume away entirely so that the interior of the floret was fully exposed, the three anthers visible, and then Vega reached in with the tweezers and pulled all three in a single motion, a quick pinch and pull that took two seconds where Harold's method took ten. Harold watched him do it three times. The boy's hands moved with a sureness that was his own, something he had arrived at by the logic of the task itself, and Harold felt something he could not have named, not jealousy and not pride exactly but something closer to relief, the relief of discovering that the work was not his alone, that it could be carried.

He did not say anything to Vega about it. He tried it himself, snipping the glumes, exposing the interior, and it was faster, clearly faster, and after a week the boys were all doing it, they had learned it from Vega without being told, the way workers learn from each other, by watching, and the number of crosses per day went up and the work expanded to fill the new capacity, because there were always more heads to emasculate than there were hands to do it, always more varieties to cross, more combinations to try, and what could be done was limited only by the number of hands and the number of hours and the willingness to sit on a stool in the sun and pull anthers from flowers until the light was gone.

Some evenings he sat outside on the step of the station and watched the light change over the valley. The canal caught the last of the sun. The fields darkened from green to a shadow-color that was almost black, and the mountains to the east became silhouettes against a sky that went from white to gold to violet in the space of minutes. He sat and felt the heat leaving his body, the muscles in his back slowly releasing, the ache in his hands fading, and the work of the day was behind him and the work of the next day was ahead of him and the space between was this, this sitting, this quiet, and it was enough.

He did not write to Ruth about the stool. He wrote about the progress, the number of varieties planted, the repairs to the irrigation system. He wrote about the boys, calling them his field assistants, a small team, good workers. He did not write about the heat or the midges or the ache in his back or the hours on the stool that had become the center of his life, the still point around which everything else revolved, because writing about it would have required him to say what it was and he did not know what it was, only that it was where he was most present, most fully there, the stool in the field with the tweezers in his hand and the wheat between his fingers and the boys working beside him and the slow accumulation of crosses that were building toward something he could not yet see.

Ruth wrote back. Her letters took weeks to arrive, coming up from Wilmington to Mexico City and then down to Obregon by mail truck, and by the time he received them the events they described had already passed, the tooth had come through, Jeanie was walking now, Ruth had seen the doctor and everything was fine, the baby was fine. She asked when he would come home. Not when are you coming back, but when, as if the return were certain, only the date unknown, and Harold read this and understood that she was being careful, that the question was not a question but a line held out across the distance between them, and he took it, he wrote back and said soon, which was not true, and she would know it was not true, and this knowledge would sit between them the way the silence sat between Harold and his father, a thing known and not spoken of, a shape in the room that everyone moved around.

He crossed wheat. That was what he did. He sat on the stool and he crossed wheat. He trimmed the spikelets and he pulled the anthers and he bagged the heads and he waited and he introduced the pollen and he waited again and he opened the bags and sometimes there was seed and sometimes there was not, and when there was seed he harvested it and labeled it and stored it in tin cans he had found in Obregon, coffee cans and biscuit tins with tight lids, and the notebooks filled up and the tin cans accumulated on the shelf in the station, rows of them, each one containing the offspring of a particular cross, a possible future.

He did not think about what the work might become. He thought about the head in his hand, the anther between the points of the tweezers, and this was not discipline or focus or any quality of character, it was simply the nature of the work, which demanded everything and gave back nothing except itself, the cross made, the bag fastened, and the knowledge that inside that bag something might be happening, a meeting of genetic material that might produce a plant that could resist the rust that was killing the wheat in this valley, and this possibility was what he carried from head to head, from row to row, from day to day, the way a man carries a debt, silently, in the body, without putting it down.

The stool. He came back to it every morning the way a man comes back to his workbench or his plow or his desk, and the stool received him the way those things receive the people who use them, without judgment, without expectation, a plain wooden object that existed for the purpose of holding him while he worked, and he sat on it and the day began.
