# Chapter 4: The Road

The road from the Yaqui Valley to Mexico City was eleven hundred kilometers and it took two days if nothing went wrong, which it usually did, a flat tire on the gravel stretch outside Los Mochis or a fuel stop that turned into three hours waiting for a mechanic who was eating lunch or sleeping or simply not there, and by the second trip Harold had learned to carry two spare tires and a full jerrycan strapped to the bed of the truck and to leave before dawn so that the worst of the mountain roads could be covered in daylight. Rupert drove the first leg, south through Sinaloa on a road that followed the coastal plain between the Sierra Madre and the sea, and the landscape was flat and dry and brown, the color of everything Harold had come to know in the Yaqui Valley, the mesquite and cactus and the thin cattle standing in whatever shade they could find, their ribs showing through hides that looked as though they had been hung over a frame and left to dry. Then the road turned inland and began to climb.

The mountains changed everything. The air, first. He could feel it thinning as they gained altitude, the truck's engine working harder on the grades, the exhaust note changing, and the temperature dropped in stages, so that by the time they were above two thousand meters he was reaching behind the seat for the jacket he had learned to keep there, and the sweat that had been on his back since before dawn had dried and the skin underneath was cool and slightly tight. The vegetation changed with the air, the desert scrub giving way to broadleaf forest, oaks and sweetgums, and then higher up the pines, tall and straight, their trunks reddish in the late-afternoon light, and between them the undergrowth was thick and green and wet-looking, a green that was almost violent after the months of brown, and the smell of it came through the truck windows, pine and the darker richer smell of soil that held moisture, soil that was black and dense and alive in a way that the Yaqui Valley soil was not, and Harold breathed it in and felt his body respond to it the way a body responds to water after thirst, not with gratitude exactly but with recognition.

They came down out of the mountains and into the Valley of Toluca in the early evening. It lay below them like something cupped in two hands, a broad flat floor of fields and towns surrounded on all sides by mountains, and to the southwest the Nevado de Toluca rose above everything, its summit white with snow even now, in spring, a volcanic cone so symmetrical it looked drawn, and the light at that hour was different from any light Harold knew, not the flat white blaze of the Yaqui Valley or the hard clear light of Iowa but something softer, filtered through the thin air at twenty-six hundred meters, gold and pink at the edges, falling across the valley floor in long reaches, catching the fields and the scattered trees and the river that wound through the center, the Lerma, narrow and unhurried, reflecting the sky.

The research plots were outside Chapingo, on a piece of land that belonged to the agricultural school, and when they arrived it was nearly dark and the air was cold enough that his breath showed. He stood in the field with the truck still running behind him and held a handful of the soil and squeezed it and it held its shape, dark and dense, the consistency of modeling clay, and when he brought it to his nose it smelled of rain and roots and the particular sweetness of high-altitude earth, and he could feel the cold of it against his palm, the cold of soil that was not baked and bleached and cracked but wet and dark and full.

The idea had come to him in the field. Not as an idea in the way that word is usually meant, not as a thought that arrived fully formed, but as an observation, a small practical thing. The crosses that survived in the Yaqui Valley needed to be tested somewhere else, because a plant that thrived at sea level in the desert might fail at altitude in the cold, and a plant that failed in both places was useless, and a plant that thrived in both was something worth keeping. This was obvious. But the implication of it was that he could grow two crops a year instead of one. Plant in the Yaqui Valley in winter, harvest in spring, drive the seed south, plant in Toluca in summer, harvest in fall, drive the seed north, plant again. Two generations. Two chances to select, to cross, to test. The calendar would have no gap in it. There would always be a crop in the ground.

He wrote to Stakman about it. A letter on notebook paper, in the careful handwriting he used for correspondence, explaining what he wanted to do and why. He did not write about the other thing, the thing he could not have articulated even to himself, which was that the idea of a gap in the work, a season with nothing to tend, nothing to measure, nothing to walk out to in the morning with the stool and the tweezers and the notebooks, was something he could not tolerate, the way certain sounds are intolerable to certain people, not because the sound itself is harmful but because of what it opens onto, the space behind it, and Harold did not think about this because he did not think about things in that way, he thought about wheat, about rust, about the number of crosses per season and the years that could be saved if the work never stopped, and Stakman would understand this because Stakman understood work.

Stakman wrote back and said yes.

Harrar said no.

The meeting was in Mexico City, in the offices on Londres Street, a room on the second floor with tall windows, and Harrar sat behind his desk and Harold sat in a chair across from him, and Rupert was there, in another chair by the wall, and Harrar explained his position. The shuttle breeding was unorthodox. It was too expensive. Seeds needed a year of rest between plantings, this was established practice, Professor Hayes at Minnesota had confirmed it. The program could not support the cost of two planting sites and the transportation between them.

Harold listened. He sat in the chair and his hands were on the arms of the chair and his face showed nothing, the same face he wore in the field, patient, still, and he listened to Harrar talk about budgets and orthodoxy and what Professor Hayes had said, and something rose in him while he listened, something that was not anger exactly, or was anger but of a kind so unfamiliar to him that he did not recognize it as such, a tightness in his chest that was different from the tightness of grief, harder, hotter, a pressure that gathered behind his sternum and spread outward into his arms and his jaw, and his hands on the arms of the chair tightened and he waited for Harrar to finish and when Harrar finished he spoke.

He said that the wheat could not be bred fast enough if they planted only once a year. He said that the rust was changing, that new races were appearing, and that by the time a variety was released it might already be obsolete. He said that the only way to stay ahead was to shorten the cycle, and the only way to shorten the cycle was to plant in both places. He said these things in a voice that was not loud and was not calm, that was something between the two, a voice he had never heard himself use before and that came from the place where the pressure was, the hard hot place behind his breastbone, and Harold said, if I am not permitted to do that, I will leave.

The words came out and they were in the room and they could not be taken back and Harold did not want to take them back. He stood up. The chair scraped against the floor. He turned and walked toward the door and behind him he heard another chair scrape and he did not turn around but he knew it was Rupert, because Rupert was the kind of man who stood up when someone he worked with stood up, not out of loyalty in the dramatic sense but out of the simpler fact of alignment, of having worked beside someone long enough that your movements began to follow theirs, and they walked out and neither of them spoke in the hallway or on the stairs or on the street outside, where the noise of Mexico City traffic was loud and constant, and they walked to the corner and stood there and Harold's hands were shaking, a fine tremor in his fingers that he could see when he held them up, and he put them in his pockets and stood there.

Stakman intervened. Harold did not know the details of how, only that Stakman spoke to Harrar and spoke to the Foundation and spoke to whoever else needed speaking to, and when it was done Harold had permission to continue. The shuttle would go on.

Ruth and Jeanie moved to Mexico City that year. Ruth had made the decision the way she made all decisions, practically, without drama, assessing the facts and determining the course that made the most sense, and the facts were that Harold was not coming back to Wilmington and that a family separated by two thousand miles and a foreign border was not a family in any functional sense, and so she packed what they owned into trunks and shipped them and flew with Jeanie to Mexico City and found an apartment, a small place with two bedrooms and a kitchen that had a gas stove and a window that looked out onto a courtyard where a jacaranda tree grew, and when Harold came back from the Yaqui Valley in April she was there.

The apartment was on the third floor. The stairs were narrow and dark and smelled of cooking from the other units, onions and oil and chili and corn, and the sounds of other families came through the walls, the voices of children and the clatter of dishes and the radio playing music Harold could not identify, a guitar and a horn and a voice singing in a register that was high and sustained and full of something he did not have a word for. Ruth had arranged the furniture, what there was of it, a table and four chairs that did not match, a sofa that sagged in the middle, a rug she had bought at a market, and Jeanie's things were in the smaller bedroom, a crib and a dresser and a box of toys, wooden blocks and cloth dolls and a stuffed rabbit that she carried everywhere and that was already losing its fur in patches.

Jeanie was two. She walked now, a wide-legged determined walk, and she talked, a few words, mama and papa and agua, which she had picked up from the courtyard children, and when Harold came through the door she looked at him with an expression that was not recognition exactly but something close to it, a kind of assessment, as though she were deciding whether he was the same person who had left, and then she held up her arms and he picked her up and her weight was solid and more substantial than he expected, and she smelled of soap and milk and the particular warmth of a child's skin, and he held her and Ruth watched him hold her from the kitchen doorway and her face was careful, the face of a woman observing something she had hoped for and was now seeing and was not yet certain about.

They ate dinner at the table. Rice and beans and a chicken that Ruth had roasted, and the food was good and the apartment was warm and they ate and talked about practical things, the neighborhood, where to buy food, where the school would be when Jeanie was old enough, and the conversation moved through the meal the way conversations do, covering the surface of things, and beneath the surface were the other things, the things they did not say, Scotty's name not spoken, his absence not mentioned, the fact of it there between them like the table itself, a solid object they both sat at and neither looked at directly.

He washed the dishes. Ruth dried. The kitchen was small enough that they stood close together at the sink, their elbows almost touching, and the water was warm and Harold washed each plate and glass and fork with the same thoroughness he brought to everything, and Ruth took them from him and dried them and placed them in the cabinet, and they did this in silence, a silence that was not uncomfortable but that contained things, the way a room contains air, invisibly, pressingly, the silence of two people who had been married long enough to know that speech was not always required and that its absence was not always a failure.

The work in Toluca was the same work as in the Yaqui Valley, the stool, the scissors, the tweezers, the paper bags, the notebooks, but it was different too. The light was different. In the Yaqui Valley the light was a force, a weight, something that pressed down on everything and flattened it, but here the light was thinner, clearer, it had edges, it defined the shapes of things rather than dissolving them, and the wheat in this light looked different, the heads sharper, the stems more distinct, each plant a separate thing. He worked without sweating. His shirt stayed dry. The mosquitoes were gone. The air moved through the rows with a coolness that had weight to it, the weight of altitude, and his hands were steadier in this coolness, the tweezers more precise, and the work was easier on his body, his back less stiff at the end of the day, as though the place itself was gentler on the machinery of him.

But the wheat that grew here was not the wheat that grew in the Yaqui Valley. The same seed, the same crosses, planted in this soil at this altitude, produced plants that were different, taller or shorter, earlier or later, the heads larger or smaller, the stems thicker or thinner, and some of the varieties that had thrived at sea level failed here, their leaves yellowing, their growth stunted, and some that had been mediocre in the heat came alive at altitude, strong-stemmed and full-headed, as though they had been waiting for this place, and Harold recorded all of it in the notebooks, and the patterns began to emerge, slowly, the way patterns always emerge, not as revelations but as repetitions, the same result appearing again and again until it could no longer be attributed to chance. The ones that grew well in both places were the ones he kept. He simply kept what worked and discarded what did not, the way any farmer does, the way his father had done, choosing the best ears of corn for next year's seed, and the plants that could be taken from sea level to twenty-six hundred meters and back again without failing were rare, and they were what he was looking for, though he did not know why they were rare or what quality they possessed that made them adaptable, he only knew that the shuttle was finding them and that without the shuttle they would not have been found.

The seasons turned. Yaqui in winter, Toluca in summer, the road between, the seed in the truck, the same eleven hundred kilometers through the same landscape that was never the same because the light changed and the season changed and he was older each time he drove it, his hands a little stiffer on the wheel, his back a little more set in the curve the stool had given it. He drove south in October with the Yaqui harvest in burlap sacks, each sack a generation that had survived the desert and would now face the mountains. He drove north in April with the Toluca harvest, the mountains falling away, the pines giving way to scrub, the air thickening and warming, the first heat of the Sonoran desert pressing against the truck windows like a hand, and he rolled the windows down and the heat came in and he was back, back in the country of the stool, the country of dust and canals and the flat white sky.

The years passed. Nineteen forty-six, forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty. The numbers were in the notebooks, in the dates at the top of each entry, and the notebooks accumulated on the shelf in the Yaqui station and on a smaller shelf in the Toluca shed, stacks of spiral-bound books with curled covers and smudged pages, and inside them the record of every cross, every head, every planting, and Harold filled them and stored them and started new ones and filled those too, and the handwriting in the early notebooks was the same as the handwriting in the later ones, the same careful tight script that he had been taught in the one-room school in Iowa and had carried with him ever since, across the country, across the border, into the fields.

The first improved varieties went out to farmers in forty-eight. Kentana and Yaqui 48, named for the places that made them. They were not perfect. They were better than what the farmers had, which was wheat that died of rust three years out of five, and the farmers planted them because the alternative was to plant nothing, and the wheat grew and did not die and the harvest was larger than they were used to, not dramatically larger, not the kind of increase that makes a man stand in his field and stare, but enough, enough more that they noticed, and they came back the next year for more seed, and the year after that more of them came, and the work that Harold had been doing on the stool for four years began to produce something that existed outside the notebooks and the tin cans and the test plots, something that grew in other people's fields and fed other people's families, and Harold noted this in the same way he noted everything, in the ledger, in the careful hand, without commentary, a fact among facts.

He drove the road. That was the thing he did now, the thing that defined the shape of his year the way the stool defined the shape of his day. The road and the stool. The long drive and the small seat. The movement between places and the stillness within them. He drove north in October and south in April and each trip was the same trip and each trip was different, the road a little more familiar so that he knew where the bad patches were, where the gravel gave way to dirt, where the potholes could break an axle, where to stop for fuel and where not to stop because the fuel was watered, and the road was as much a part of the work as the stool was, the means by which the work continued, the thread that connected the two halves of the shuttle into a single motion.

He read to Jeanie at night. He sat on the edge of her bed and held the book open and read the words, simple words, pictures of animals and their names, a cow, a horse, a chicken, and Jeanie pointed at the pictures and said the words or approximations of them, and Harold turned the pages and the book was small in his hands, his broad field-worn hands that spent their days with tweezers and scissors and wheat heads, and the smallness of the book and the smallness of the child and the smallness of the room were a different scale from the scale he worked at in the fields, the long rows, the open sky, the distances, and he adjusted to this scale the way he adjusted to everything, by paying attention, by being where he was, and if there was a strain in the adjustment it was in his body, in the way he held himself slightly too still on the edge of the bed, slightly too upright, as though he were being careful not to take up too much space.

In the evenings when he was home he sat at the table and wrote in the ledger and Ruth sat in the chair by the window and read, and the lamp made a circle of light on the table and another circle on the pages of her book, and between them Jeanie slept in her room, her breathing audible through the thin wall, and the sounds of the building came and went, doors closing, water running, the radio from downstairs, and they sat in their separate circles of light and did not speak, and the silence was not empty, it was full, full of the day and the work and the child and the road and the seed and the two valleys and the distance between all of these things, and they sat in it and let it hold them, two people in a small apartment in a foreign city, married, parents, alive, doing what they could with what they had, which was not enough and was what there was.
