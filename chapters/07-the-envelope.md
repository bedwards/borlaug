# Chapter 7: The Envelope

The letter he wrote to Vogel was one page. He wrote it at the table in the station after the day's work, the lantern on, the insects at the screen, and outside the last of the light going from the fields. He had been thinking about it for weeks, not the letter itself but the problem that required the letter, the two problems that were in fact one problem, two faces of the same insufficiency, and the letter, when he finally wrote it, was the simplest thing he had done in months.

He had spent the spring going through the collection. The USDA World Wheat Germplasm Collection had sent him four hundred and sixty-two accessions in small paper envelopes, and Harold had planted them all in test rows at the Yaqui station, four rows each, irrigated and fertilized at standard rates, and he had walked those rows every day for two months, measuring height, measuring stem diameter, measuring the way the plant held itself under its own weight, the relationship between the mass of the head and the strength of the stalk that carried it, and what he was looking for was something shorter, something stiffer, something that would not fall over. He did not find it. Four hundred and sixty-two accessions from twenty-three countries, and not one of them was what he needed.

Because they fell over. This was the problem that had become the problem, the one that sat underneath the other problems and made them worse. The tall varieties, the ones he had spent eight years developing, Yaqui 48 and Chapingo 52 and the Lerma lines, these plants stood four and a half feet high, some of them five feet, and they grew well and they yielded well and when the rains came at the right time and the rust held off they produced more grain than anything the Mexican farmers had seen, and this was the work, this was what the work had built, and it was not enough, because the moment you gave those plants more fertilizer, the moment you tried to push the yield higher, the stems could not hold it. The heads grew heavier with grain and the stems were too long and too thin and the plants bent, and then they broke, and then they fell, and a field that had been standing wheat became a mat of tangled stalks lying flat against the mud, the heads on the ground, the grain rotting, the harvest ruined. Lodging, it was called. A lodged field looked like something had walked through it and pressed everything down, the plants not snapped but buckled, bent at the nodes, the stems curved over like the necks of animals lying down, and once a plant lodged it did not come back up, the stem kinked at the bend, the vessels that carried water and nutrients crimped shut, and the plant died where it lay.

Harold had seen this happen. He had stood at the edge of a field that a farmer named Delgado had planted with Yaqui 48 and fertilized at twice the recommended rate, and the field had lodged after a rain, the whole thing, two hectares lying flat, and Delgado had stood beside him and said nothing, and Harold had said nothing, because there was nothing to say, the plants were built that way, tall and thin because that was what wheat was, what wheat had been for ten thousand years, and the tallness was the problem and there was nothing Harold could do about it with the material he had.

The other problem was 15B. Stakman's letters had been coming since the previous autumn, each one more specific, the language tightening the way Stakman's language tightened when he was concerned, because race 15B of Puccinia graminis was something new. It had appeared in the northern plains and it was breaking the resistance genes that Harold's varieties carried, the genes he had spent years selecting for, and if 15B reached the Yaqui Valley the work would be set back by years. He had Lerma 52, a variety released that spring, and it carried resistance to 15B, the seedlings clean after inoculation in the greenhouse. But the flour was wrong. The millers in Sonora had tested it and the gluten was weak, the dough slack, the bread flat and dense, and the farmers would not grow a wheat that the millers would not buy, and so Lerma 52 sat in the catalogue like a tool that could do one thing and not the other.

So the two problems. Tall plants that fell over. A new rust race that broke the old resistance. And both problems pointed in the same direction, which was that Harold needed new material, new genes, something from outside the collection he had been working with, something he had not tried.

He had heard about the Japanese wheat from Stakman. A variety called Norin 10 that had been collected from a nursery near Morioka after the war, sent to the United States, distributed to a handful of breeders. The plants were short. Not a little short but dramatically short, two feet, two and a half feet, the stems thick and stiff and the heads compact, the reason genetic, a set of dwarfing genes that reduced the internode length, that changed the fundamental proportions of the plant. And there was a man in Washington State, at the university in Pullman, who had been crossing this Japanese material with American winter wheats. His name was Orville Vogel, and Harold had never met him.

The letter took fifteen minutes. Harold wrote it in his careful hand, legible without being elegant, the letters formed individually, each one complete before the next began. He wrote the date and the address and the salutation, Dear Dr. Vogel, and then the body, which was four paragraphs, precise and dry and saying exactly what needed to be said. He described the program. He described the lodging problem. He described the need for shorter, stiffer varieties that could absorb fertilizer without falling over. He requested seed, specifically crosses between Norin 10 and the variety Brevor 14 that Vogel had been developing, whatever generations were available, something that carried the dwarfing genes in a background he could cross into his Mexican lines.

He read the letter over. He changed one word, replacing request with ask, because the formality of request did not match what he was doing, which was asking, one breeder asking another for seed, the oldest transaction in the work, the exchange of material that had been happening between farmers and breeders for as long as there had been farming, a handful of seed passed from one hand to another across a fence or a border or an ocean, the material moving because the work required it to move. He signed it, folded it, put it in an envelope, addressed it, and set it on the shelf beside the lantern to be mailed in the morning.

The letter went north. Harold went back to the field.

Weeks passed. The work absorbed him the way it always absorbed him, the stool and the tweezers and the rows, and Harold did not think about the letter because thinking about it would not make it arrive faster, and waiting for something that might or might not come was not a thing his mind did willingly, his mind being made for the work in front of it, for the head in his hand, for the anther between the tweezers, and the letter was somewhere between Pullman and Obregon, and Harold was in the field.

The envelope arrived on a morning that was no different from any other morning. It was in the stack of mail that the driver brought from Obregon twice a week, and Harold went through the stack at the table after the midday break, sorting it, and there it was, a small envelope, standard size, with a return address in Pullman, Washington, and his name and the station address written in a hand he did not recognize.

He opened it. Inside was a single sheet of paper, folded around a smaller envelope. The letter was brief, shorter than the one Harold had written, and it said that Vogel was pleased to send the requested material, that the enclosed seed was from crosses of Norin 10 with Brevor 14, F2 generation, and that he wished Harold success with it. The tone was professional, warm without being familiar, the tone of a man who understood the request because he was doing the same work.

Harold opened the smaller envelope and tipped the seeds into his palm. There were not many. A few dozen, small brown wheat seeds, unremarkable in every way, identical in appearance to the thousands of other wheat seeds in the tins on the shelf, indistinguishable from the seeds of any bread wheat growing in any field in the Yaqui Valley or anywhere else. They sat in his palm, dry and hard, and he looked at them. He turned his hand slightly and they shifted, rolling against each other with a faint dry sound, and then he closed his hand around them and the seeds were warm from his skin and he could feel them, the small hard individual shapes of them, pressing against the flesh of his palm.

He put them in a tin. A small tin, a coffee tin with a tight lid, and he labeled it in pencil on a strip of tape, the cross designation and the date and the source, and he set the tin on the shelf with the others and went back to the field.

He planted them in the next cycle, in the nursery rows at the Yaqui station, the furrows opened with a hoe, the seeds placed by hand, the soil closed over them, the water let in from the canal. Vega helped. They worked the short row together in the late afternoon, Harold placing the seeds at intervals along the furrow, Vega covering them, and neither of them spoke about what the seeds were or where they had come from because Vega did not ask and Harold did not offer, the planting being the planting, a thing to do, and they did it.

The seeds germinated. The shoots came up in the usual way, pale green, thin, pushing through the crust of soil, and in the first weeks there was nothing to see, nothing that distinguished these plants from any others, because all wheat seedlings look the same, the same blade, the same color, the same tentative emergence into the light.

As the plants grew the differences appeared. They were short. This was the first thing, the thing he had expected and the thing that was still surprising when he saw it, the plants reaching a height and stopping, the stems thickening instead of lengthening, the leaves broader and darker green than the plants in the adjacent rows, and by the time the heads began to emerge the Norin 10 crosses stood barely to Harold's waist while the Mexican varieties beside them reached his chest and beyond. The shortness was visible from across the field, a step down in the canopy, a depression in the otherwise level surface of the wheat, and Harold stood at the end of the row and looked at them, short and thick-stemmed in the sun.

But the heads were wrong. The grain was shriveled, the kernels thin and light, and when Harold threshed a sample by hand, rubbing the heads between his palms over a sheet of paper, the kernels that fell out were small and poorly filled, and the weight of them was not the weight of good grain. The leaves were too broad. Some of the plants had a laxness to them, a looseness in the way the leaves hung that suggested poor adaptation, the genes from Japan not suited to the conditions in Mexico, the daylength wrong, the temperature wrong, something wrong that expressed itself in the limp quality of the foliage and in the thin disappointing grain. And some of the plants, the shortest ones, had not headed at all, had stopped growing at eighteen inches and stayed there, green and stubby and sterile, as if the dwarfing had gone too far and taken the reproduction with it.

Harold recorded all of this. He walked the row with the notebook and wrote down what he saw, plant by plant, the height in centimeters and the number of tillers and the head type and the grain quality and the disease notes, and the notation was thorough and the notation was discouraging, because what it said was that the dwarfing genes had come through, the plants were short, and the shortness had brought with it a catalogue of problems that would have to be separated out, trait by trait, cross by cross, generation by generation, before the shortness could be used.

The dwarfing was not a single gene but a complex, multiple genes acting together, and these genes were linked to other genes on the same chromosomes, genes that controlled grain quality and leaf shape and maturity and a dozen other traits, and when you brought the dwarfing into a new background you brought all of it, the good and the bad bound together, and the work of separating them was the work of crosses and generations, of crossing the short plants with the tall Mexican varieties and selecting the individuals that were short and also had good grain, short and also matured on time, short and also resisted the rust, and then crossing those again and selecting again, each generation a sieve, and the sieve was Harold's eye and Harold's hand, the judgment made in the field, plant by plant, the decision to keep this one and discard that one.

He began the crosses that winter. He took pollen from his best Mexican varieties and put it on the stigmas of the Norin 10 plants that had headed, the ones that were short but not sterile, and he bagged them and waited and harvested the seed and planted it in Toluca for the summer cycle. The F1 generation was uniform and tall, every plant, because the dwarfing genes were recessive and the tall genes from the Mexican parent were dominant, the dwarfing hidden inside the plants like a word that has been spoken but not yet heard, and Harold harvested the seed and carried it back to the Yaqui Valley for the winter planting.

The F2 was where the segregation began, the generation that opened up, where the hidden traits reappeared and the combinations multiplied and each plant was different from every other plant, and Harold walked the field every day with the notebook and the measuring stick. He had tall plants and short plants and plants in between. He had plants with good grain and plants with bad grain and plants with no grain at all. The variation was enormous, far greater than anything he had seen, because the parents were so different, the Japanese dwarf and the Mexican tall, separated by thousands of miles and thousands of years of selection in opposite directions, and their offspring were scattered across the entire range of possibility.

Most of what he selected was wrong. The ratio of failure to success was worse than it had ever been, because the linkages between the dwarfing genes and the undesirable traits were tight, the genes sitting close together on the chromosome, and breaking those linkages required the rare recombination event, the crossover that happened in one plant out of a hundred or one out of a thousand, and finding that plant meant looking at all of them, every one, and Harold looked.

He sat on the stool. He looked at a plant. He measured it. He examined the head, the grain, the stem, the leaves. He checked for rust. He made a judgment. He moved to the next plant. And the next. And the next. Down the row, one at a time, the stool scraping in the dirt as he shifted it forward, the notebook filling, the pencil wearing down, and the sun moved across the sky and the heat built and the irrigation canal murmured and the field was the field, the same field it had always been, the same stool, the same tweezers, the same bags, but the work inside the work had changed, had become finer, more demanding, because the differences between the plants he wanted and the plants he did not want were small, were sometimes a matter of centimeters, a few grams of grain weight, a slight difference in the color of the leaves, and the eye had to see these differences and the hand had to act on them and both were Harold's, and both were Vega's, and between them they worked the rows.

The second year was harder. The F3, and the variation still enormous, the dwarfing appearing and disappearing in the offspring like a thing glimpsed and lost, the linkages holding, the short plants still carrying the bad grain, the plants with good grain still tall, and Harold selected the rare individuals that broke the pattern and saved their seed and planted it and selected again. The third year. The fourth. The generations accumulated season by season, the shuttle between the Yaqui Valley and Toluca continuing, the dwarf genes moving back and forth across Mexico in tin cans in the back of a truck, each generation a little closer to something or a little further from it, Harold could not always tell which, the progress not linear but branching, and the entire architecture of the breeding program was housed in the notebooks and in the head of the man who sat on the stool.

The rust came to the Yaqui Valley in fifty-four, not 15B but a related race, and the plots Harold had planted with the older varieties showed it first, the orange pustules appearing on the stems, and Harold walked the rows and marked the susceptible plants and pulled them, and then he walked the dwarf rows and some were clean and some were not and he noted which were which, one more column in a table that grew wider with each season, each trait a dimension of the problem, and the solution, if there was a solution, existed at the intersection of all of them, the plant that was short and strong-stemmed and resistant and early-maturing and produced good grain, and this plant did not exist yet.

He did not talk about the work to Ruth. He went to Mexico City when the schedule allowed, and Ruth asked about the planting and he said it was going well, which was true and was also not the thing, not the real report, which would have required him to explain the dwarf crosses and the linkage problem and the slow uncertain progress through the generations, and this was not a thing he could explain because the explaining would have required him to say what he was feeling about the work, and what he was feeling was not a thing he had words for, a tightness in the chest that was not anxiety and not excitement but something in between, and the only response to the feeling was the work itself, the stool, the tweezers, the rows.

By fifty-five the lines were stabilizing, the variation narrowing, the plants within each line beginning to look more like each other, and among them were individuals that Harold looked at longer than others, plants that were shorter than the Mexican standard and that stood well and that had heads with grain that was heavier than it should have been, heavier than the other short plants, and Harold marked these with a red tag tied to the stem and harvested them separately and stored their seed in separate tins, and the entries in the ledger said what the plants were, their height and their yield and their rust reaction, and the entries did not say what Harold saw when he looked at them, which was the first sign that the linkage was breaking, that the dwarfing genes were beginning to separate from the bad traits, that somewhere in the recombination the crossover had happened and a plant had received the shortness without the penalty, or with less of it, and this plant was standing in his field and he had marked it and he would cross it again and the process would continue.

The notebooks from these years were different from the earlier ones. The entries were longer, more detailed, the numbers more numerous, more columns, more measurements, as if the work itself had become denser, and Harold sat at the table in the evenings and copied the day's records into the ledger and the lantern burned and the notebooks filled and each notebook was a season and each season was a generation and the generations were moving, slowly, through the problem.

Vega understood what they were doing. Harold had not explained it with the language of genetics and linkage, but Vega had been in the rows with him, had seen Harold's hand go to certain plants and pass over others, and the pattern of his selection was visible to someone who had been watching his hands for twelve years, and Vega asked one day whether the short ones would ever be as good as the tall ones, and Harold said he did not know, and this was true, and the truth of it sat between them the way many things sat between them, because the not-knowing did not change the work, did not slow the hands or close the notebook, it was simply another condition, like the heat, like the rust, like the distance from home, and they worked inside it.

By fifty-six the rows at the Yaqui station held fourteen hundred lines descended from the original envelope of seed, and Harold walked them every morning, the short ones and the tall ones and the ones in between, and among the red-tagged individuals, more of them now, a dozen, then twenty, then thirty, plants that were short and strong and filling their grain and standing up in the field while the tall plants beside them bent and lodged after the February rains, the short ones standing and the tall ones down, and what he saw was the answer beginning to form, not yet clear, not yet clean, still carrying problems that would take more years to fix, but beginning, the shape of it emerging the way a row of wheat emerges from a muddy field in the first weeks after planting, faint and uncertain but there, and Harold counted them and recorded them and saved their seed and the work went on.

He sat on the stool. The stool was the same stool, repaired again, the seat worn to a smoothness that was almost soft, the three legs fitted to his weight, and he sat on it and the morning began and the scissors were in his hand and the tweezers were in his hand and the head was in front of him and the work was there, the same work, the work that had been there since the beginning and that would be there after this generation and the next and the one after that, and Harold did the work, and the days passed, and the seasons passed, and the seed moved back and forth across Mexico in the back of a truck, and the notebooks filled, and the lantern burned, and the answer was in the field, somewhere in the rows, in the red-tagged plants that stood while the others fell, and Harold would find it or he would not find it and either way the stool would be there in the morning and he would sit on it and the work would begin again.
