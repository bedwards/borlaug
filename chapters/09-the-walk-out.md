# Chapter 9: The Walk-Out

The committee met in a room on the third floor of the Foundation building, a room Harold had not been in before, larger than Harrar's office, with a long table and eight chairs and a window that looked out onto the street where the traffic moved in its usual disorder, the buses and the taxis and the vendors' carts, and the sounds of it came faintly through the glass, a background hum that Harold was aware of the way he was aware of the irrigation canal at the station, as something that was always there and did not require attention. He had come from the bus station with the ledger under his arm and his field bag over his shoulder and he had changed his shirt at Ruth's insistence, the clean white shirt that she had ironed and hung in the closet for occasions like this, though occasions like this did not happen often enough for the shirt to have lost its creases, and he wore it buttoned to the collar and the collar was tight against his neck and he could feel it when he swallowed.

There were six men at the table. Harrar at the head, in his tie and jacket. Two men from the Foundation's New York office, whose names Harold had been told and would not remember, men in dark suits with clean hands, clean in a way Harold noticed because his own hands were not, the knuckles thickened and the nails carrying, in the creases and under the edges, the faint dark line of field soil that did not come out. A man from the USDA, a wheat pathologist who took notes on a yellow legal pad. Narvaez, who ran the Chapingo station now and who sat at the far end with his arms crossed. And a representative of the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture, a small man with a careful mustache.

Harold opened the ledger. He had brought three notebooks as well, the field notebooks from the last two seasons, and he set them on the table beside the ledger and opened the ledger to the page he had marked with a strip of paper, the page with the yield comparisons, the tall varieties and the dwarf varieties, the columns of numbers that he had written at the station table under the lantern, and he turned the ledger so that the men at the table could see it, the way he had turned it for Harrar months ago, and he said what the numbers were.

He spoke the way he spoke in the field, plainly, without preamble. He said that the semi-dwarf varieties had been tested for three seasons at the Yaqui station and two seasons at Toluca. He said the yield advantage was twenty to forty percent over the best tall varieties under standard fertilization, and that it increased with higher fertilization because the short stems did not lodge. He said the rust resistance was comparable to the best tall lines. He said the grain quality was acceptable, within the range the millers would take, and that he was continuing to select for improvement. He said the varieties were ready for wider testing.

The men listened. One of the New York men wrote something in a leather notebook. Harrar sat with his hands flat on the table and his face composed in the way it was always composed when Harold presented results, attentive and contained, the face of a man who waited for the whole of a thing before responding to any part of it.

The questions came when Harold stopped speaking. The first New York man asked about the appearance of the plants, about whether farmers would accept a wheat that looked different from what they were used to, that stood only to their waist when wheat had always stood to their chest or higher, and Harold said that farmers would plant what yielded. The second asked about the millers, about gluten strength and protein content and baking quality, and Harold opened one of the notebooks and read the numbers from the quality tests, the farinograph readings and the loaf volumes, numbers that Evangelina had generated in the laboratory, and the numbers were adequate, within the acceptable range though not at the top of it, and Harold said this plainly, that the quality was not yet where he wanted it and that he was selecting for it. The USDA man asked about the stability of the dwarfing genes across environments, and Harold said they were stable, the same in every generation, a structural change in the plant, not a response to conditions. The Ministry man asked one question, in Spanish, about fertilizer requirements, and Harold answered in the working Spanish he had acquired over eighteen years, imprecise but adequate, and Narvaez translated a phrase Harold had struggled with, quietly, without looking at him.

The meeting lasted forty minutes. When there were no more questions Harold closed the ledger and sat with his hands on the table and waited.

Harrar spoke. He thanked Harold for the presentation, the thanks formal, correct, the thanks of a director addressing a subordinate in front of visitors, and then he said what Harold had known he would say before he said it, because Harrar had said the same thing in his office months ago and because institutions said the same things the same way every time, the words interchangeable, the meaning constant. More testing was needed. The results were promising but the data set was limited. Before any official release, the committee recommended an additional two years of regional trials at multiple sites under the standard evaluation protocol, with replicated plots and independent verification and a full quality analysis at each location.

Two years. Harold heard the number and the number entered him through his ears and moved through his body the way a swallow of cold water moves, a line of sensation from the throat to the chest, and his jaw tightened, the muscles at the hinge of it, and his hands on the table pressed flat, the fingertips whitening against the wood, and the pressure was there again, the thing he had felt in this building years ago, in Harrar's office, the day he had stood up and said he would leave, the hot tight compression behind the breastbone that was not a thought but a physical event, a thing his body did, and he sat with it. The two New York men were looking at their notebooks. The Ministry man was looking at the table. Narvaez was looking at Harold.

Harold said, I understand.

He stood up. He picked up the ledger and the bag and thanked the committee and left. He walked down the hallway, which was long and dim and smelled of floor wax, and down the stairs, and out onto the street, where a woman was selling tamales from a cart on the corner, the steam rising from the pot, and Harold stood on the sidewalk with the ledger under his arm and the clean shirt tight at the collar and the pressure still in his chest, and he stood there.

He took the bus back to the Yaqui Valley. Sixteen hours. Harold sat by the window and did not sleep and did not open the ledger. The pressure in his chest did not dissipate, did not build, simply remained, a constant, like the heat coming through the window, something that accompanied him north.

He arrived at the station in the early morning. Vega was already there, the truck parked by the station building and the light on inside. He walked in and set the bag down and Vega looked up from the table where he was sorting seed packets and said, how did it go.

Harold poured coffee from the pot on the stove, the coffee that Vega made each morning, strong and bitter, and he drank half the cup standing at the counter and set it down and said, two more years.

Vega's hands stopped moving over the seed packets. He looked at Harold. His face did not change in any obvious way, but something in it shifted, a tightening around the eyes, the expression of a man absorbing a loss without performing the absorption.

He said, two years of trials.

Harold said, yes.

They stood in the station, the coffee cooling and the light changing outside as the sun came up, and neither of them said anything about what two years meant, about the farmers still planting the tall varieties and still watching them lodge, and neither of them said anything about the dwarf seed in the tins on the shelf behind Vega's head, the seed that was ready, that had been ready for a year, that could be in the ground by the next planting if anyone would let it.

Harold finished his coffee and went outside and walked the rows in the early light, the dwarf plots at his waist, the heads heavy, the stems straight, and the tall plots beside them at his chest, the stems thinner, swaying in the breeze off the canal, and he walked the rows the way he walked them every morning, looking, the way a man looks at a thing he has made and knows to be sound.

He did not decide. That was not how it happened. There was no moment of resolution, no hour in which Harold sat at the table and weighed the arguments and chose a course of action. What happened was that three days after he returned from Mexico City he drove the truck to the seed storage shed behind the station and opened the tins, the tins with the red labels, the ones that held the seed from his best dwarf lines, Pitic 62 and the line he was calling Penjamo, and he scooped the seed into burlap sacks, one sack for each tin, and he labeled the sacks and tied them and loaded them into the bed of the truck, six sacks, each one holding enough seed to plant two hectares, and Vega came out of the station and saw what Harold was doing and walked to the truck and began loading sacks beside him without speaking.

They drove south along the valley road, past the fields planted with the tall varieties, the Lerma Rojo and the Yaqui 50, the wheat standing high and green in the February morning, and the sacks shifted and settled against each other in the bed of the truck on the rough road, and the dust rose behind them and hung in the still air.

The first farm was Delgado's. Harold had known Delgado for fifteen years, since the early days of the program, and Delgado had planted everything Harold had given him since then, not because he was incurious but because the varieties had worked, each one better than the last, and the relationship between the two men was built on this, on seed given and seed planted and harvests that came in, a transaction repeated across years until it did not require explanation.

Delgado was in his yard, repairing a hoe, fitting a new handle into the head, tapping the wedge in with a mallet. He was a short man, broad through the chest, his skin darkened to the color of the soil he worked, and he wore a shapeless straw hat and a cotton shirt with the sleeves rolled above his elbows, and he looked up when the truck pulled in and set the mallet down and walked over.

Harold got out. Vega got out on the other side. Harold went to the bed of the truck and untied one of the sacks and opened it so that Delgado could see the seed inside, the small brown kernels, wheat seed, and Delgado looked at the seed and then looked at Harold.

Harold told him what the seed was. He spoke in the slow careful Spanish that was all he had, and when the words would not come Vega supplied them, standing at Harold's elbow, filling in the gaps. Harold said the seed was a short wheat, that it would only reach his waist, but that it would yield more and would not fall over. He said to plant it alongside the regular wheat and to watch it.

Delgado reached into the sack and took a handful and held it, the way any farmer looks at seed, the weight of it in the palm, the feel of it between the fingers, and the seed looked like any other seed, small and brown and hard. He looked at Harold with an expression that was not doubt exactly but a suspension, a waiting.

He asked how short.

Harold held his hand at his waist. This high, he said.

Delgado looked at Harold's hand and then looked at the sack and then looked at his fields, where the tall wheat was growing, the plants already to his chest, and the looking was the looking of a man measuring one thing against another, the known against the unknown, and he said nothing for a moment. Then he took the sack from Harold's hands and carried it to the shed at the edge of his yard and set it inside.

They drove on. The next farm was two kilometers down the road, a man named Robles, who farmed forty hectares with his two sons and who had been planting Harold's varieties for ten years. Harold gave him a sack and Vega explained the seed and Robles listened and asked how much to plant per hectare and Harold told him and Robles nodded and his sons carried the sack to the barn. The next farm, another two sacks, two brothers whose names Harold knew and whose fields he had walked through on visits over the years, and the brothers were skeptical, one of them holding the seed in his hand and looking at Harold with an expression that was close to amusement, short wheat, wheat to the waist, and Harold said to plant it and see.

Six farms. Six sacks. The drive took the morning, the truck stopping at each farm, Harold getting out and opening a sack and explaining the seed and Vega beside him putting into Spanish what Harold could not manage, and at each stop the exchange was the same, the seed offered and examined and questioned and accepted, because these were farmers who knew Harold, who had planted his seed before, and if he was now bringing them something short and strange they would plant it because he brought it.

They drove back to the station in the afternoon. The bed of the truck was empty and Vega drove because Harold was tired, the tiredness not of the body but of something else, a heaviness that had settled in him during the drive, the weight of having done something that was outside the protocol and that could not be undone, and Harold sat in the passenger seat and looked at the fields and did not speak.

He did not tell Harrar. He did not write it in any report. What he had done was not official, was not part of any trial, was a man giving seed to other men and saying plant it, which was the oldest thing in agriculture and the thing that no committee could approve or deny because it happened between people in a yard, in the dust, and it had been happening for ten thousand years.

The farmers planted the seed. Harold did not visit the farms again for weeks. He was in the field at the station, working the new crosses, the next generation, the continuation of the work that did not stop because the previous generation had been given away. Vega was with him, the two of them on the stools, the scissors and the tweezers, the paper bags rustling in the breeze from the canal, and the work absorbed them the way it always absorbed them, completely, the days measured in rows completed and heads emasculated and bags labeled and notebooks filled.

The seed germinated. Harold heard this from Delgado, who stopped by the station one afternoon to return a hand seeder and mentioned that the short wheat had come up. Harold asked how it looked and Delgado shrugged and said it looked like wheat, short wheat, and Harold said good and Delgado drove away.

The plants grew. The weeks passed. Harold worked at the station and did not visit the farms, stayed on the stool, kept the hands busy, because looking at the farmers' fields would not make the plants grow faster and working at the station would produce the next generation, and the next generation was always the point.

But the valley talked. This was how information moved in the Yaqui Valley, not through reports or publications or committee decisions but through conversations at the grain elevator and the feed store and the irrigation office, through talk between men who farmed adjacent fields and who met on the roads and at the market in Obregon, and what the talk said was that the short wheat was growing, that it looked strange, but that the heads were heavy and the stems were not bending and the fields that had the short wheat in them looked different from the fields that did not.

The harvest came. Delgado came to the station, not to return equipment but to stand in the yard and tell Harold what had happened. He stood with his hat in his hand, the straw hat, and he turned it slowly by the brim while he talked, and what he said was that the short wheat had outyielded everything else on his farm. Not by a little. He said the number, the kilograms per hectare, and the number was higher than any number Delgado had ever reported, and he said it plainly, with the flatness of a man stating a fact he has verified and does not need to embellish, and then he put his hat back on and asked Harold for more seed.

Robles came next. Then one of the brothers. The numbers were all in the same range, twenty to forty percent above the tall varieties, the same advantage Harold had seen on the station plots, confirmed now not in the controlled conditions of the research field but in the rough uneven conditions of real farms, farms with their own soil and their own water and their own problems, and the advantage had held.

More farmers came. Men Harold had not given seed to, men from other parts of the valley who had heard about the short wheat and had stood at the edge of the fields and seen what was there to see, and they came to the station and asked for seed. Harold gave them what he had. Vega helped, measuring and sacking and labeling and explaining in the Spanish that was his own language the details of planting rate and fertilizer application and row spacing, the details that Harold could manage in English but that came out cleaner and faster in Vega's voice, and the seed moved out into the valley.

The Foundation found out. Harold did not know exactly when or how. It did not matter. What mattered was the meeting, another meeting, this one in Harrar's office, just the two of them, Harrar behind the desk and Harold in the chair, and Harrar said that he understood Harold had been distributing unreleased material to farmers without authorization.

Harold said yes.

Harrar looked at him. The looking was the look of a man who had managed Harold for eighteen years and who had learned that the usual instruments of institutional authority, protocol and procedure and the chain of approval, were things Harold observed when they aligned with the work and disregarded when they did not, and Harrar had fought with Harold about this before and had lost and had learned something from the losing, though what he had learned was difficult to name.

Harrar said the protocol existed for a reason. That untested varieties could fail and discredit the program. That the Foundation had obligations to the Mexican government.

Harold listened the way he had listened in this office years ago, when the subject was shuttle breeding and the result was Harold standing up and walking out. The listening was the same, patient and contained, but the thing underneath it was different, was not the hot sharp pressure of the younger man but something quieter, the weariness of a man who was tired of explaining what was already visible in the fields.

Harold said the farmers had the data. He said the yields were confirmed. He said the seed was performing in the farmers' fields the way it had performed on the station, and that the farmers were asking for more.

Harrar was quiet. He looked at the ledger, the same numbers now augmented by the on-farm results, the farmers' yields in a separate column in Harold's handwriting, and the numbers were there, in the book, undeniable. He looked at Harold and Harold looked back and the quiet between them was the quiet of two men who had argued and compromised and continued, imperfectly, incompletely, but enough.

Harrar closed the ledger. He said he would speak to New York. He said the on-farm results would be incorporated into the evaluation. He did not say that Harold should continue distributing seed, and he did not say that Harold should stop.

Harold stood up. He picked up the ledger. He thanked Harrar and left, and the leaving was different from the leaving years ago, when he had walked out with the pressure behind his breastbone and Rupert's chair scraping the floor behind him. This leaving was quiet. He walked down the hallway and down the stairs and out onto the street and the pressure was not in his chest, was not anywhere, and in its place was something that was not triumph and not relief but the flat calm of a thing completed, a motion that had begun when he loaded the sacks into the truck and that had ended here, in this office, with a man closing a ledger and saying he would make a phone call.

The varieties were released that year. Pitic 62 and Penjamo 62, the names given officially, the paperwork completed, the protocol satisfied retroactively by the data that Harold and the farmers had already generated. The release was not an event. There was a document filed somewhere in the Foundation offices, and there was the seed, which was already in the fields, already growing, because Harold had put it there months before the document existed.

The valley changed. Not all at once but over the following years, farm by farm, the short wheat replacing the tall, not through argument or institutional authority but through the simplest proof, one farmer seeing what his neighbor had grown and asking for the seed, the seed moving from hand to hand the way seed had always moved, because the wheat was shorter and the heads were heavier and the plants did not fall over and this was visible, this was a thing a man could see standing at the edge of his field, and seeing it he did not need anyone to explain it.

Harold went back to the field. The station plots were planted now with the semi-dwarf varieties, the canopy at his waist, the proportions of the field changed, the world he worked in literally lower, closer to the ground, the heads nearer to his hands when he sat on the stool, and the light came differently into this shorter field, came all the way down to the soil, and the lower leaves were green, alive, and the field had a density to it that the tall fields had not had, a compactness, the plants packed closer, more tillers, more heads per row. Harold sat in the middle of it on the stool, the same stool, the seat worn smooth, the three legs settled into the dirt, and the stool was the same and the work was the same, the scissors and the tweezers and the paper bags and the notebook, and the wheat was different. It came to his waist. The heads were at his hands. He did not have to reach up to take a head for crossing, did not have to stand or stretch. The plant was there, at the height of his sitting body, as though the wheat had been redesigned to fit the man on the stool, or as though the man on the stool had been working toward this all along, toward the plant that met him where he was.

He took a head in his hand. The head was heavy, the spikelets packed tight, the grain filling, and he trimmed the spikelets at the tip and the base and took the tweezers and began to emasculate, pulling the anthers one by one, the small green sacs coming out clean, and the work was the work, the same precise slow work he had been doing since he first sat on this stool eighteen years ago, and the afternoon was warm and the canal murmured and the canopy of short wheat surrounded him, waist-high, dense, still, and Harold worked, his hands steady, his back curved, the notebook open on his knee, the pencil behind his ear, and the field was quiet, and the stool was solid under him, and the wheat was there.
