## I. ACTUAL PROSE EXCERPTS

### From *A Death in the Family* (My Struggle, Book 1)

**The famous opening:**

> "For the heart, life is simple: it beats for as long as it can. Then it stops."

**On mortality and the body:**

> "The moment life departs the body, it belongs to death."

**On forms and the world (near the conclusion, encountering his father's corpse):**

> "For humans are merely one form among many, which the world produces over and over again, not only in everything that lives but also in everything that does not live, drawn in sand, stone, and water."

**Physical observation -- rain on a table (a characteristic passage of pure description):**

> "The table lay under a film of water; the seat covers were dark with moisture. Plastic bottles lying on their sides on the brick floor were dotted with raindrops. The bottlenecks reminded me of muzzles, as if they were small cannons with their barrels pointing in all directions. Raindrops hung in clusters along the underside of the wrought-iron fence. Now and then one let go and fell onto the wall beneath with an almost imperceptible plop."

**On the cleaning of the house (the 71-page sequence after his father's death):**

This is described as dry on the sentence level -- "I filled the bucket with water, took a bottle of Klorin, a bottle of green soap and a bottle of Jif scouring cream..." -- but the slow accrual of detail masterfully evokes the effort to reckon with the past.

**On his father's rage:**

> "His fury struck like a wave," washing through rooms and "lashed and lashed and lashed at me."

**On his own nature:**

> "I never say what I really mean, what I really think."

**On childhood confidence:**

> "About me it was said that I always knew best and I was always boasting. But I did know best, I knew much more than the others, so why should I pretend anything else?"

### From *A Man in Love* (My Struggle, Book 2)

**The key passage -- the title theme, the struggle itself:**

> "Everyday life, with its duties and routines, was something I endured, not a thing I enjoyed, not something that was meaningful or made me happy. This had nothing to do with a lack of desire to wash floors or change nappies but rather with something more fundamental: the life around me was not meaningful. I always longed to be away from it, and always had done. So the life I led was not my own. I tried to make it mine, this was my struggle, because of course I wanted it, but I failed, the longing for something else undermined all my efforts."

**On falling in love:**

> "For the first time in my life I was completely happy. For the first time there was nothing in my life that could overshadow the happiness I felt. We were together constantly, suddenly reaching for each other at traffic lights, across a restaurant table, on buses, in parks, there were no demands or desires except for each other. I felt utterly free, but only with her, the moment we were apart I began to have yearnings."

**Writing about Linda -- the accumulative "I wrote" passage:**

> "I wrote down what she meant to me. I wrote what she had been for me when I saw her for the first time and what she was now. I wrote about her lips sliding over her teeth when she got excited. I wrote about her eyes, when they sparkled and when they opened their darkness and seemed to absorb light. I wrote about the way she walked, the little, almost mannequin-like, waggle of her backside. I wrote about her tiny Japanese features. I wrote about her laughter, which could sometimes wash over everything, how I loved her then. I wrote about the words she used most often, how I loved the way she said 'stars' and the way she flung around the word 'fantastic'. I wrote that all this was what I had seen, and that I didn't know her at all, had no idea what ran through her mind and very little about how she saw the world and the people in it, but that what I could see was enough. I knew I loved her and always would."

Note the technique here: anaphora ("I wrote... I wrote... I wrote...") building through accumulation. Each clause adds one more specific sensory detail. The passage moves from abstract ("what she meant to me") to physical ("her lips sliding over her teeth") to the admission of not-knowing, and then the final declaration. This is vintage Knausgaard.

**Domestic disaster (the chaotic family bridge scene):**

> "...so twenty minutes later we found ourselves on a high, narrow and very busy bridge, grappling with two buggies, hungry, and with only an industrial area in sight. Linda was furious, her eyes were black, we were always getting into situations like this, she hissed, no one else did, we were useless, now we should be eating, the whole family, we could have been really enjoying ourselves, instead we were out here in a gale-force wind with cars whizzing by, suffocating from exhaust fumes on this bloody bridge. Had I ever seen any other families with three children outside in situations like this?"

**Tenderness and its unbearability:**

> "At the traffic lights across from us a car was revving, and when I turned my head I saw the sound was coming from one of those enormous jeep-like vehicles that had begun to fill our streets in recent years. The tenderness I felt for Vanja was so great it was almost tearing me to pieces. To counteract it, I broke into a jog."

**On art:**

> "Fictional writing has no value, documentary narrative has no value. The only genres I saw value in, which still conferred meaning, were diaries and essays, the types of literature that did not deal with narrative, that were not about anything, but just consisted of a voice, the voice of your own personality, a life, a face, a gaze you could meet. What is a work of art if not the gaze of another person? Not directed above us, not beneath us, but at the same height as our own gaze. Art cannot be experienced collectively, nothing can, art is something you are alone with."

**The literary ambition passage:**

> "I had one opportunity. I had to cut all my ties with the flattering, thoroughly corrupt world of culture in which everyone, every single little upstart, was for sale, cut all my ties with the vacuous TV and newspaper world, sit down in a room and read in earnest, not contemporary literature but literature of the highest quality, and then write as if my life depended on it. For twenty years if need be."

> "But I couldn't grasp the opportunity. I had a family and I owed it to them to be there. I had friends. And I had a weakness in my character which meant that I would say yes, yes, when I wanted to say no, no, which was so afraid of hurting others, which was so afraid of conflict and which was so afraid of not being liked that it could forgo all principles, all dreams, all opportunities, everything that smacked of truth, to prevent this happening."

### From *Boyhood Island* (My Struggle, Book 3)

**Opening -- the impossibility of memory:**

> "Of course, I don't remember any of this time."

> "...it is completely impossible to identify with the infant my parents photographed; this is in fact so difficult it almost seems wrong to use the word 'I' when referring to it, lying in the baby bath, for instance, its skin unnaturally red, its arms and legs sprawling, and its face distorted in a scream no one remembers the reason for anymore..."

**On memory's unreliability:**

> "Memory is not a reliable quantity in life... Memory is pragmatic, it is sly and artful, but not in any malicious way; on the contrary it does everything it can to keep its host satisfied... That which is remembered accurately is never given to you to determine."

**On events dispersing:**

> "...the small incidents of childhood have no more gravity than the dust stirred up by a passing car, or the seeds of a withering dandelion dispersed by the breath of a small mouth."

**Grandparents observed:**

> "I never quite understood what the power relationship was between grandma and grandad. On the one hand, she always served him food, cooked all the meals, did all the washing-up and the housework as though she were his servant; on the other hand, she was often angry or irritated with him, and then she gave him a mouthful or made a fool of him, she was sharp and not infrequently sarcastic, while he said very little, preferring not to respond. Was it because he didn't need to? Because nothing of what she said altered anything important? Or because he couldn't?"

### From the Seasons Quartet (*Autumn*, *Winter*, *Spring*, *Summer*)

**The address to the unborn child (*Autumn*):**

> "I want to show you our world as it is now: the door, the floor, the water tap and the sink, the garden chair close to the wall beneath the kitchen window, the sun, the water, the trees."

**On a chair (*Autumn* -- his method of describing objects):**

> "A chair is for sitting on. It consists of four legs on which rests a board."

**Winter sounds:**

> "The screech of a crow... which in summer is just one note in a greater tapestry of sound, in winter is allowed to fill the air alone, and every single nuance in its rasping, hoarse, seemingly consonant-filled caws stands out: how they rise aggressively at first, then descend mournfully towards the end, leaving behind a sometimes melancholy, sometimes eerie mood among the trees."

> "That sound, which is no sound, only a nuance of silence, a kind of intensifying or deepening of it, is the sonic expression of winter's essence."

**On family:**

> "A household of family... exists in the real and aspires towards the ideal. All tragedies arise out of this duality, but also all triumphs."

**Christmas cleaning:**

> "And the feeling of triumph is what prevails in me now, when the kitchen in the house on the other side of the lawn, lit up like a train compartment in the darkness, where only a few hours ago I did the Christmas cleaning, is sparkling clean and bright."

**On writing (from *Summer*):**

> "Only by forgetting that one is writing can one write."

---

### Other Key Quotes

**From Book 5:**

> "The heart is always right. It never errs. The heart never errs. The heart never ever errs."

> "I felt the impact of time, it came like a blow."

**On reading:**

> "Reading a good novel is like seeing a landscape emerge when water subsides."

**On writing and solitude:**

> "Few things are a more satisfying substitute for the presence of other people than writing."

## II. STYLE ANALYSIS: WHAT MAKES KNAUSGAARD DISTINCTIVE

### The Anti-Style as Style

James Wood, in his foundational 2012 *New Yorker* review, described the prose as having "a flatness and a prolixity... the long sentences have about them an almost careless avant-gardism, with their conversational additions and splayed run-ons." He noted that "truth is repeatedly being struck at, not chatted up," and described the concluding sentences of Book 1 as "placid, plain, achieved," possessing what Walter Benjamin called "the epic side of truth, wisdom."

Wood also found in Knausgaard "simplicity and pungency and innocence of the truth-telling" and called the writing "intense and utterly honest, unafraid to voice universal anxieties, unafraid to appear naive or awkward."

Crucially, Knausgaard *deliberately* adopted this approach. As he told the *Paris Review*: "I want to write how I really think things are, instead of how I think you should think I think things are."

### Description as the Central Device

The *Point Magazine* essay "Describing My Struggle" identifies description as "the key formal device in My Struggle" because it "unites the voice of the subject (of the narrator or writer) with his or her interest in the object of the description," achieving "inexhaustible precision" which is Knausgaard's aesthetic ideal.

The work "strings together an immense number of descriptions without much of a plot, unless life itself is taken to be a plot." Because the prose is "purely descriptive, the quality of its prose becomes immediately irrelevant, as it's impossible to disagree with factual statements -- 'I felt embarrassed' or descriptions of concrete actions -- it's only possible to listen."

### The Cumulative Effect (Not the Chiseled Sentence)

The *n+1* essay "Scandinavian Style" makes a critical distinction: "Knausgaard rejects chiseled sentences in favor of a cumulative effect, and the flatness, the openness, the sprawl provide the space necessary for his discursive treatment of everyday life, allowing the reader to exist inside the narrator's mind, to see as he sees."

The sentences are described as "loping and gentle, usually unfurling in one direction rather than doubling back and twisting around themselves."

This is a key point for imitation: individual sentences are often unremarkable. The power comes from accumulation. A passage about cleaning a house becomes devastating not because any single sentence is brilliant, but because seventy-one pages of scrubbing away filth becomes an act of grief.

### Speed and Non-Revision

Knausgaard wrote My Struggle at a furious pace with minimal revision. As he described it, he focused on "achieving a hypnotic state in which words would flow out as memories seeped up out of his consciousness."

He theorized that "it might be possible to improve upon bad writing and extraneous detail by expanding upon it -- letting branches of thought, story, and feeling grow and bloom instead of pruning them back."

His rule, as he told *n+1*: "What if, when a sentence or a scene was bad, I expanded it, and poured in more and more?"

### Francine Prose's Key Distinction

Francine Prose, in her *Harper's* essay "Master of the Mundane," made a crucial observation: "Knausgaard has frequently been compared to Proust, but in fact the two writers have little in common except the length and ambition of their books and their fascination with memory. Even at their most poetic, Knausgaard's sentences are shorter and punchier than Proust's, less ornately strung with dependent clauses. And Knausgaard seems obsessed less with recapturing the past than with escaping it."

She also noted: "It is a tribute to his prodigious grace and skill that although he goes on and on about himself, My Struggle possesses not a hint of the narcissism and solipsism that tend to mar memoirs and autobiographical novels."

### Fredric Jameson's "Itemisation"

Fredric Jameson, in the *London Review of Books*, called Knausgaard's method "itemisation" -- arguing that "feelings and emotions in the volumes are itemised rather than expressed, and personal relations are listed and noted down rather than dramatised." This is not a criticism but a description of the formal principle at work.

### Ben Lerner's "Each Cornflake"

Ben Lerner, also in the *LRB*, observed that "the extreme inclusiveness of Knausgaard's attention and the flatness of the language in which it's conveyed feels universal, less interested in exceptional life than in how any life can feel exceptional to its subject." Lerner characterized much of My Struggle as functioning as "an immersive environment" rather than conventional narrative.

## III. TECHNIQUE: HOW HE DOES IT

### Handling of Time

Knausgaard uses abrupt, unpredictable shifts in time, place, and register. Book 1 opens with a philosophical meditation on death, jumps to the narrator as a child watching news footage, moves forward to adult life, then back to adolescence, and then forward again to the central event (the father's death and the house-cleaning).

Within the Seasons Quartet, he noted: "While so far in this text 'I' have represented a forty-seven-year-old Norwegian man residing in Sweden with a wife and four children, 'I' will soon, as soon as this sentence ends, represent a seventy-three-year-old woman who is sitting at a writing desk in an apartment in Malmo on a summer evening."

The present tense is used sparingly but powerfully -- mostly the books are in past tense, but the immediacy comes from the *density* of physical detail, not from tense.

### Interiority

Knausgaard works "from the interior outward," with each memory triggering associations that reveal "bigger existential mysteries." His method is myopic and raw -- the consciousness wanders from a Stockholm walk into social criticism before shifting to personal introspection.

He grounds emotional experience in bodily sensation rather than psychological interpretation. Feeling is rendered through physical consequence: "The tenderness I felt for Vanja was so great it was almost tearing me to pieces. To counteract it, I broke into a jog."

As he told *Hazlitt*: "This isn't about remembering things, this is about staging or re-staging something that I have inside of me. I'm a Proustian in that sense, I believe in memories outside of consciousness, and this is just a way to find them."

### Repetition

Repetition is a structural principle. See the "I wrote... I wrote... I wrote..." passage above. Also: "The heart is always right. It never errs. The heart never errs. The heart never ever errs." These anaphoric constructions build emotional intensity through recurrence rather than variation.

At the macro level, the books repeat situations -- childcare, cooking, social gatherings, marital arguments -- creating a rhythm that mirrors life's actual repetitions. This is not laziness; it is the formal enactment of what daily life feels like.

### Paragraph Structure

He writes long paragraphs. Very long. The prose sustains itself over extended stretches without conventional scene breaks or white space. This creates the "immersive environment" Lerner describes -- you cannot easily dip in and out. You must submit to the rhythm.

The typical Knausgaard paragraph might begin with a physical action, move into observation of the surroundings, shift into a memory triggered by some detail, engage in philosophical or emotional reflection, then return to the present physical scene. The transitions are often invisible -- one thought simply becomes the next.

### Dialogue

Dialogue is rendered plainly, often summarized rather than quoted directly. When it is quoted, it lacks the zingy quality of American realist fiction. Characters say ordinary things. The power comes from what surrounds the dialogue -- the narrator's observation of the speaker's face, the emotional undertow.

### Adjectives and Figurative Language

Knausgaard's prose is largely unadorned. As critics have noted, "most figurative language comes in the form of cliches and mixed metaphors." This is deliberate. He abandons "good writing" -- simile, metaphor, syntactic complexity, linguistic compression, symbols, elaborate structures -- in the name of speed and directness.

When a simile does appear, it is often homely: bottlenecks remind him of muzzles, a lit kitchen looks like a train compartment. These comparisons emerge from ordinary perception, not literary ambition.

### The Role of the Translator

Don Bartlett, who translated Books 1-4, described wanting "the feel of English but the intensity of Karl Ove." He insists on replicating Knausgaard's punctuation -- favoring commas over semicolons and colons, because "they interrupt the flow and make the text feel too organized." The resulting English "hits somewhere between British and American English" and maintains the fluid, unpunctuated quality of the Norwegian.

---

## IV. WHAT TO EMULATE

1. **Sentences that breathe.** The loping, forward-moving sentence that unfurls in one direction. Not syntactically complex but rhythmically alive. Commas, not semicolons. Additions and run-ons that feel like thought continuing.

2. **Accumulation of real detail.** Not one perfect detail; twenty ordinary ones. The power is cumulative. The reader begins to *inhabit* the space rather than merely observe it.

3. **The world as it feels when you are actually in it.** Mundane, sensory, physical. Weather, light, objects, textures. When he panics at a lost sock, or mentally interrupts a conversation by wondering whether he forgot his bathing suit, the reader tangibly experiences those moments.

4. **Unsentimental observation.** "Every detail put down without apparent vanity or decoration, as if the writing and the living are happening simultaneously."

5. **The courage to dwell.** Knausgaard does not fast-forward through the mundane details of life -- the meals, the conflicting thoughts, the wrong turns -- just to arrive at the next scene. The dwelling *is* the point.

6. **Emotion rendered physically.** Tenderness tears him to pieces, so he jogs. Fury strikes like a wave. The body carries the feeling; the prose does not editorialize.

7. **Philosophical reflection emerging from action.** The essays and meditations grow organically from the described scenes. He does not step outside the narrative to philosophize; the thinking is embedded in the doing.

8. **The "I wrote" structure.** Anaphoric repetition building through specificity toward an emotional conclusion. This can be adapted beyond literal writing -- any repeated action accumulating toward revelation.

9. **Honesty about ambivalence.** He does not stifle the futile, aching urge to protect his children, nor conceal the shameful urge to judge and disparage them over trifles. Both exist simultaneously. Both are recorded.

---

## V. WHAT TO AVOID (Lessons from Bad Imitations)

1. **Over-specific timestamps and locations.** "At 3:47 PM on a Tuesday in the Safeway on Hawthorne Boulevard." Knausgaard is specific but not clinical. He says "one Wednesday at the end of August," not "Wednesday, August 27th, 2003, at 2:15 PM." The specificity serves embodiment, not documentation.

2. **Hyper-specificity about mundane objects (the "60hz hum" problem).** Describing the exact wattage of a lightbulb or the frequency of electrical hum is *not* what Knausgaard does. His details are sensory and experiential -- what things look like, feel like, how they register in consciousness. Not technical specifications masquerading as perception.

3. **Excessive hedging with "perhaps" and "maybe."** While Knausgaard does express uncertainty, it is usually about emotional or psychological states ("Was it because he didn't need to? Because nothing of what she said altered anything important? Or because he couldn't?"). It is not a verbal tic applied to every observation. Bad imitations scatter "perhaps" and "maybe" across descriptions of physical reality, which creates a wishy-washy quality foreign to Knausgaard's actual directness about the material world.

4. **Flatness without purpose.** Knausgaard's flat prose has an "active, throbbing pulse" underneath. The flatness is the surface; intensity is the undertow. Simply writing boringly about boring things is not the same as what he does. As one critic noted, "even when he was bored he remained interested."

5. **Mistaking length for depth.** Writing long is not the same as writing in Knausgaard's mode. His length serves accumulation and immersion. Each detail adds to the total environment. If your long passage could be cut by half without losing anything, it is padding, not Knausgaardian fullness.

6. **Narcissistic navel-gazing.** As Francine Prose observed, despite writing thousands of pages about himself, Knausgaard's work "possesses not a hint of the narcissism and solipsism that tend to mar memoirs." The self-examination is in service of understanding the world, not displaying the self. The gaze moves outward even when the subject is inward.

7. **Manufactured profundity in the mundane.** Knausgaard does not *make* breakfast profound. He describes breakfast with such thoroughness that its actual qualities -- warmth, routine, the presence of family, the texture of bread -- become visible. The profundity is already there; he simply refuses to look away. A bad imitation strains to inject meaning into a description of toast.

8. **Overuse of present tense for false immediacy.** Knausgaard primarily writes in past tense. The immediacy comes from the density and precision of physical detail, not from tense manipulation. Switching everything to present tense creates a breathless, blog-post quality that is the opposite of his measured, retrospective flow.

## VI. KNAUSGAARD ON HIS OWN METHOD

**On the novel as room:**
> "I feel the novel is very much like a room, or rooms: that you're in this room or that room, and that the whole aim of writing is to create a room where you can say something."

**On breaking free:**
> "You have to do something extreme to break free, you have to describe a cock, maybe, for 40 pages, and then you will reach something else."

**On writing as escape from self:**
> "It's a way of getting free from yourself in a way. It's the only place I know of where I am free of myself."

**On the need for a lack of empathy:**
> "It's really important to be free and independent in the writing... some sort of lack of empathy that makes it possible for me to write."

**On the secondary nature of writing:**
> "The book is secondary, as a description of experience, not as an experience."

**On childhood landscape:**
> "Landscape in childhood is not like the landscape that follows later; they are charged in very different ways."

**On what was lost:**
> "The sole difference, which is the difference between a child's reality and an adult's, was that they were no longer laden with meaning."

**On writing location and aim:**
> "Writing is drawing the essence of what we know out of the shadows. That is what writing is about... the there itself. There, that is writing's location and aim."

**On the frustration that led to My Struggle:**
> "I was looking for something and at the end I was so frustrated I thought I would just write it as it was, no tricks, no nothing."

## VIII. SUMMARY: THE KNAUSGAARD EFFECT

The fundamental insight: Knausgaard's prose works not because individual sentences are beautiful (they often are not) but because the *total accumulation* creates an immersive environment that replicates the texture of lived experience. The reader stops reading *about* a life and begins to *inhabit* it.

The method is: plain language, forward-moving sentences, relentless physical detail, emotional honesty rendered through bodily sensation, philosophical reflection emerging naturally from described action, and a refusal to distinguish between "important" and "unimportant" moments. Everything receives the same quality of attention.

The result is what Ben Lerner described: "less interested in exceptional life than in how any life can feel exceptional to its subject."

For the Borlaug project, the applicable principles are: the accumulation of agricultural and scientific detail as world-building; the rendering of institutional life (conferences, field stations, laboratories) with the same immersive attention Knausgaard gives to domestic life; the philosophical themes (hunger, duty, ambition, the meaning of a life spent in service) emerging from physical description rather than being imposed upon it; and the emotional register -- unsentimental, honest, grounded in the body and the senses.
