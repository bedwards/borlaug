# Matt and Abigail — Source Character Descriptions

These are the psychological profiles to be merged with the Norman Borlaug character. The novel character is NOT a therapist's patient — these profiles inform the *interior psychology* of the character as expressed through action, dialogue, and behavior in the context of 1940s-60s Mexico wheat breeding.

## Key Psychological Themes to Integrate

### From Matt:
- **Compartmentalization**: Keeps aspects of self cut off from each other. "In his most intimate relationships, he was never altogether himself."
- **Inability to hate**: Raised in a family where anger was treated as temporary insanity. Parents reacted with alarm and anxiety to anger. "Instead of learning how to hate, Matt learned to try not to hate at all."
- **Busyness as defense**: "Matt's sex life was busy, hectic even. The other thing: he didn't lose his temper or get angry." Constant motion prevents feeling hate toward loved ones.
- **Performing niceness**: "It must be exhausting being nice all the time." Matt laughed. "It is."
- **Feeling slightly unreal**: "I feel slightly unreal" — the cost of never being altogether oneself.
- **Split between duty and desire**: Loves the "deeply reassuring rhythms and rituals" of family life AND needs an intense, disinhibited private self.
- **Intimacy vs. love confusion**: Thinks love is "an equivalence of power, an agreed understanding between two people about their desires."
- **The breakthrough**: After years, finally expressing hate — "You don't like me. I don't like you... You hate me. I hate you."

### From Abigail:
- **Unwanted child**: "You wanted her, you deal with her." Father was affectionate with sisters but never with her.
- **Internal monologue directed at absent father**: "I'm talking to him in my head all the time."
- **Work as antidote to father**: "Each time a client chose her, Abigail felt special" — winning over what the father withheld.
- **Revenge drama**: "I get to do this, and you can't stop me." A consuming revenge drama directed at her father.
- **The cure that isn't**: "Sex work cured me of my father." But it hadn't — he still filled her mind.
- **Longing for recognition**: The craving to be chosen, to be special, to have won someone over.
- **The turning point**: "As he decreased in size, I had more room in my head for my own life."

## How These Map to the Borlaug Character

The novel's protagonist carries these psychological structures into his work in Mexico:

1. **Compartmentalization**: The character's life in the wheat fields is separate from his life with his wife. He is never altogether himself in either place. The fields are where he is most alive — but that aliveness is inaccessible to the people who love him.

2. **Inability to hate / performing niceness**: With the Mexican farmers, with colleagues, with bureaucrats — he is relentlessly diplomatic, patient, good. But this costs him. The suppressed anger surfaces in the work itself — the violence of plant breeding (emasculating wheat heads, destroying failed crosses).

3. **Work as antidote to father**: The obsessive devotion to the work — the 16-hour days, the refusal to rest — is not heroism. It is a man running from something. Each successful cross is a small victory over the voice in his head.

4. **Internal monologue**: He is always talking to someone who isn't there. A father, a version of himself, a judge. The reader may not know this directly — it manifests in the way he works, what he notices, what he ignores.

5. **Feeling slightly unreal**: In the heat of the Yaqui Valley, bent over wheat plants for hours, the world takes on an unreal quality. This is both literal (heat exhaustion, monotony) and psychological.

6. **Split between duty and desire**: He loves his wife. He loves the wheat. These loves are incompatible. Not because of another person, but because of what the work requires of him — total absorption, total absence from domestic life.

7. **The consuming revenge drama**: "I get to do this, and you can't stop me." The stubbornness, the refusal to quit when everyone says it's impossible — this isn't just scientific conviction. It's personal.

## The Broader Psychoanalytic Framework

From the source text:
- "We can only make sense of our sexual selves if we travel toward ourselves."
- "How we think is who we are."
- "Our sex lives can be thought of as a solution to the problems given to us by our earliest fears, longings, and animosities."
- "Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real." (Iris Murdoch)

**For the novel**: The character's relationship to wheat — to the physical act of breeding, crossing, selecting — carries the same emotional weight as Matt's and Abigail's sexual lives. The work IS the intimate life. The novel lets this emerge without stating it.
